When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,
The way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm wit you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love your doing no one else can

Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R O C, uh oh, oh
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only,
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony, Soprano
The rock handle like Van Axel,
I shake phoneys man, You can't get next to,
The genuine article I go I do not sing though,
I sling though, If anything I bling yo,
a star like Ringo, roll like a gringo
Crazy bring ya whole set,
Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane?
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla.
Been dealing with chain smokers,
But how you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer the game's over,
Fall back young, ever since I made the changeover
to platinum the game's been a wrap, One!

[INTERLUDE]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cuz your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby hey
