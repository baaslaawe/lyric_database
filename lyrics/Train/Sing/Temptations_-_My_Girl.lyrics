[VERSE]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
doo doo
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May

[CHORUS]
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

[VERSE]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
doo doo
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

[CHORUS]
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooh hoo
