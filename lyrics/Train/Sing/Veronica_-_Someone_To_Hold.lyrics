[VERSE]
Time after time, when I'm alone
I keep thinkin' of you babe, uh yeah
and the way you make me feel, uh yeah Veronica
and I get excited, and I can't dent it, uh huh, uh huh
'cause I know when I feel this way
it just won't stay inside
with all this other half
and I'm tryin' to explain
that my heart can belong to you

[CHORUS]
All I want is someone
All I need to have
All I ask is someone 
All I need is someone to hold me
hold me, all I for someone
