Walking on thin ice, I'm paying the price
For throwing the dice in the air
Why must we learn it the hard way?
And play the game of life with your heart
I gave you my knife, you gave me my life
Like a gush of wind in my hair
Why do we forget what's been said?
And play the game of life with our hearts
I may cry someday
But the tears will dry whichever way
And when our hearts return to ashes
It'll be just a story, it'll be just a story
