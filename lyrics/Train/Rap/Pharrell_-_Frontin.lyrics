[INTRO]

[VERSE]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me
I'm sorry baby so sexy
So, you think about a chance
You find yourself try'na do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me
Uh, you do it well

[INTERLUDE]
So then we tried, bringin' it slow now
'cause you weren't used to how fast we touched
Fast we touched, uh
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up
Tear ya ass up

[CHORUS]
I know that I'm carryin' on, never mind if I'm showin' off
I was just frontin'
You know I want ya, babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know, I want ya
You should stop frontin', babe

[VERSE]
Try'na be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
And she's gon' love it
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah

[INTERLUDE]
So then we tried, bringin' it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched
Fast we touched, uh
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up
Tear ya ass up

[CHORUS]
I know that I'm carryin' on, never mind if I'm showin' off
I was just frontin'
You know I want ya, babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know, I want ya I want ya
You should stop frontin', babe

We got another one for real
Dance
I call you for real
'Cause you the truth, haha, Young great hova
Whoa, oh dance

Yeah, lemme talk to 'em
Whoa
I'mma keep it real
Everytime your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like if you was just another shawty, I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hove
I'm too old to be frontin' when I'm feelin' Denzel
And you actin' like you ain't appealing when you are
Stutin' like you ain't my only girl but you are
I was just frontin'
I'm ready to stop when you are

[CHORUS]
I know that I'm carryin' on, never mind if I'm showin' off
I was just frontin'
You know I want ya, babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know, I want ya
You should stop frontin', babe
