[VERSE]
Rubber band man

and I'm the sandman
Tote a hundred grand
Canon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick?
Well this is the wrong place man
Seven time felon, what I care about a case man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate,
so say ya grace man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigger back
I say it in his face
I'm a thoroughbred nigger
I don't fake and I don't hate
Check my resume nigger
My record's impeccable
Anywhere in the A nigger
how TIP is highly respectable
And the M I A nigger

'Cause all this tongue rustling

From the bottom of the Duval,

Stayed in some trouble man
Some niggers still hatin' on shawties

Got a couple fans

lick, suck, show 'nuff respect
but still I love 'em man
Dig it, little pimpin' got the mind and the muscle
Stay down on his grind
Put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything
and make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store
wit no trouble
Cassius clay of my day
Marvin Gaye of my time
Try'na stay alive
Living how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me
take this shit a day at a time
and told me Friday, died Sunday
Wednesday in the ground
I still smile 'cause somehow
I know he seeing me now
and so I'm doing all my shows
just like he in the crowd
Ay, throw ya lighters up for my cousin Toot rest in peace shawty,
Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master Jay

Rubber band man

Call me trouble man
I always in trouble man
I worth a couple hundred grand

[VERSE]
Grand Hustle man
Mo hustles than hustle man
But why the rubber band?
It representin' the struggle man
My folk gonna trap
until they come up wit another plan
Stack a couple grand
to get theyself off they mamma land
Gangsters who been serving
since you was doing the running man
Went down, did ten
back round and rich again
That's why I'm young
wit the soul of a old man
I'm shell shocked, get shot
slow ya roll man
Still ride around
with the glock on patrol man
nah I ain't robbing,
I'm just looking for that dro man, and who these for?
For ma niggers slanging blow, pimping hos
Rollin vogues, twenty fours
Let these other niggers know

[CHORUS]
