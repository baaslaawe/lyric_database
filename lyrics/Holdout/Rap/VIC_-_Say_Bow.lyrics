All my hustlers say bow

We got you on V I C
You got no left foot
Let go

[CHORUS]
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild go wild
It's V I C and J money, time to shut it down let go
And when we in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
Bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
Bow bow All my hustlers say bow, bow
Bow bow All my children say bow, bow

[VERSE]
We don't dance no more
All we doing is bow, bow
We don't love them ho's
All we doing is bow
It so hot up in the club club, I think I need a fan fan
See lil' mama choosy, I think I need to dance
So I ask what her name is, she said me
And who you going home with, she said me
Groupies are 100 'cause they ain't trying to get married
All they want to do is hit the sheets and the mattress

[CHORUS]
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild go wild
It's V I C and J money, time to shut it down let go
And when we in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
Bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
Bow bow All my hustlers say bow, bow
Bow bow All my children say bow, bow

[VERSE]
Everywhere I go, all the girlies know my name

They look at you and say first name, last name
It's Mr. Futuristic, call me J Louie Trump
Or Luke Skywalker or Futuristic Run
The hotties in the city, yeah we burning up
It's V I C and J money, time to turn it up
We fall up in the club, watch the crowd get silly
The way the swag servin' you can call it Free Willy
We drinkin' by the dance floor, makes the girls shake, bow
A bomb a long way, now that's a futuristic loud
Good gosh-a-mole, son, where you get the flow?
It futuristic swag now let the world know

[CHORUS]
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild go wild
It's V I C and J money, time to shut it down let go
And when we in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
Bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
Bow bow All my hustlers say bow, bow
Bow bow All my children say bow, bow

[INTERLUDE]
Got everybody leanin' and everbody rockin'
I pause for a second, but my rims still chopping
You can play the pistol, mouth stay poppin'
But we go shut it down while your record still floppin'
Problem at the club, say it to my face
Better calm your manners 'cause I'm about to catch a case
I'm a grown man buddy, I ain't got time to play games
I don't fool with y'all niggers, I don't hang with y'all lame

[CHORUS]
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild go wild
It's V I C and J money, time to shut it down let go
And when we in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
Bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
Bow bow All my hustlers say bow, bow
Bow bow All my children say bow, bow
bow bow The whole world say bow, bow
