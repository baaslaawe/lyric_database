All my hustlers say bow
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild
It's V.I.C. and J., time to shut it down
And we'll be in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
All my hustlers say bow, bow
All my children say bow, bow
The whole world say bow, bow
We don't dance no more
All we doing is bow, bow
We don't love them ho's
All we doing is bow
It so hot up in the club, I think I need a fan
See lil' mama choosy, I think I need to dance
So I ask what her name is, she said me
And who you going home with, she said me
Groupies are 100 'cause they ain't trying to get married
All they want to do is hit the sheets and the mattress
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild
It's V.I.C. and J., time to shut it down
And we'll be in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
All my hustlers say bow, bow
All my children say bow, bow
The whole world say bow, bow
Everywhere I go, all the girlies know my name
They look at you and say first name, last name
It's Mr. Futuristic, call me J-Louie-Trump
Or Luke Skywalker or Futuristic Run
The hotties in the city, yeah we burning up
It's V.I.C. and J, time to turn it up
We fall up in the club, watch the crowd get silly
The way the swag servin' you can cause us 350
We drinkin' by the dance floor, makes the girls shake, bow
A bomb a long way, now that's a futuristic loud
Good gosh-a-mole, son, where you get the flow?
It futuristic swag wherever I go
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild
It's V.I.C. and J., time to shut it down
And we'll be in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
All my hustlers say bow, bow
All my children say bow, bow
The whole world say bow, bow
Got everybody leanin' and everbody rockin'
I pause for a second, but my rims still chopping
You can play the pistol, mouth stay poppin'
But we go shut it down while your record still floppin'
Caught 'em at the club, say it to my face
Better calm your manners 'cause I'm about to catch a case
I'm a grown man buddy, I ain't got time to play games
I don't fool with y'all niggas, I don't hang with y'all lame
Pull up to the club, we be styling like wow
Futuristic swag, got the girls going wild
It's V.I.C. and J., time to shut it down
And we'll be in the building, we got 'em saying bow, bow
All my ladies say bow, bow
All my hustlers say bow, bow
All my children say bow, bow
The whole world say bow, bow
