Ready to bust the head, of a fucking pretender

Born in the dirty dirty
stoppin' they still spinnin'
they tried to hit me like fifty but bitch I'm still livin'
flinchin' I catch ya do them like them Georgia boys
the A K with the rubber grip it's something they ain't seen before
Lil' John I think they scared
Let's bring 'em down south and show 'em how our Chevies look and how our hoes bounce
Shawty don't want no trouble, shawty don't want no fight
But let 'em keep talkin' I betcha shawty gon' die tonight
I planned on gettin' put out da club before I came
My hood down for whatever
we all ride with them thangs
breaking bottles crossin' niggers heads 
and fuck what our haters said 
The gangsters don't live long is the ones that ain't breaking bread
I tried to give it up, jus' quit and let my man's get it
don't see no bricks but I still got my heads in it
Turn the key I told ya I'mma blow it up
G unit soldier my nigger
Now go and throw it up
