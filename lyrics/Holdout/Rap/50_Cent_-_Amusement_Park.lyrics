Shawty you dont have to take your pantys off
Just move 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break ya off
[VERSE]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
Theres lots of activities, fun things to do
And I find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
If you fear heights when I'm high hell yeah I'll go low
It taste so sweet, that sticky cotton candy
If you get carried away
We'll be starting a family
This is a perfect time for a magic trick
Good humor is no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now thats the first half of my act
I started out like a pimp
Now I'm more like a mac
I dont need your paper just dont f_ck with my stack
Oh its like that
yeah its like that
[Chorus]
Shawty you dont have to take your pantys off
Just move 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break ya off
[VERSE]
Now you can ride the horse round the carousel
Expolsion, trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test girl, I dont fail
I work it out, without a doubt
Theres plenty water rising sure to get you wet in the pop
Have your lustious seductions considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle
I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I dont care
I really wanna thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak
But I'm being sincere
Your pass is valid all summer my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There're so many tricks to the trade you should learn
S_ck that, lick that, swollow that lolly pop
forget that, grib that, ride it non stop
[CHORUS]
Shawty you dont have to take your pantys off
Just move 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break ya off
