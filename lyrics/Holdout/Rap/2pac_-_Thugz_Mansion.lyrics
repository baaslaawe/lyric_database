Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no Heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G at Thug Mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide
And woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
And even though we Gs, we still visualize places
That we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place
The players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball at Thug's Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thug Mansion
A place where death doesn't reside
Just thugs who collide
Not to start beef, but spark trees
No cops rollin' by, no policemen, no homicide
No chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Jose Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel that my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty some odd years and I already lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy, I dream of you more
My love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together
Sippin' heavenly champagne where angels soar
With golden wings at Thugs Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thug Mansion
Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint schnapps
With Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you understand
Only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
