[INTRO]
aha, bounce bounce bounce
bounce bounce bounce
bounce bounce bounce bounce
uh huh
check check check

[VERSE]
Yo I'm making short term goals, when the weather folds
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy
high stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
shopping sprees, coping three, deuce fever I guess its fully loaded
ah yes
bouncing in the lex luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 g's to the crap shooter
players can't fade me
chrome socks beaming, through my peripheral I see ya scheming
stop dreamin', I leave ya body steaming
brothers is feening, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any playa intervening with the sound of my money machining
my cuff running over with hundreds
I'm one of the best players that done it
six digits and running,
y'all brother don't want it
I got the godfather flow, the don Juan Demarco
swear to god, don't get it twisted

[CHORUS]
taking out this time, uh uh
to give you a piece of my mind
cause you can't knock the hustle
but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star

[VERSE]
ha, last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the south kicking up top game
bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes
screaming through the sun roof money ain't a thang
your worst fear confirmed,
me and my fam roll tight like the firm
getting down for life, s'right, you better learn
why play with fire, burn
we get together like a choir
to acquire what we desire
we do dirt like worms
produce G's like sperm
'til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes
and I sip on wine, and spit vintage flows
but y'all don't know
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
