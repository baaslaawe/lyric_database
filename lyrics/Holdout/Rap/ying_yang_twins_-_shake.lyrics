Up in the club
Forget V I P
P to da I I to da T
Ying to the Yang
Up in this thang
D to da roc
My dog Kaine
Open it cut
Pouring it up
Rolling it up
Holing it up
Ain't that thang swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That must be 2 live for your crew
Hoe get down get low
I'm crossing these mammas like tic tac toe
Let's ride lets go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown
That's right lets roll
M I A A T L fo' sho'

[VERSE]
All little mommas around the world
Shake that thang if you a nasty girl
Back that thang up says juvenile
Show them big ol' tities like girls gone wild
Take off ya dancin' clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where roughers go to 'em come outta their clothes
Shake that thang girl
Got me off in the club lookin' hard
Then drop like this drop like this
If you wanna make the money shawty work that work that
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
Do a 3 point stance
But you pleasure yourself
You must be on that Kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

Checkin' out dem jeans 
Checkin' out our twins
Is the realest true players in the A T L
Can we break it down for the shake a booty girls
And them girls in the club with the real tight clothes
One time for the gang with the Ying Yang Twins
We already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talking
Girl u can get to walking
Patron is where I'm gwaking
The only way that we gon' talk
If your breath smells like mine
Girl don't give a 'cos you fine

So while we in the club betta get these girls
'Cos on the streets there ain't no action
