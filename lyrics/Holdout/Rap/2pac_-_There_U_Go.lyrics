[INTRO]
I don't know why I be fuckin' witchu

[VERSE]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind
Times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal with
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggaz
I gotta blame my attraction shit but you became a distraction
A threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[CHORUS]
There you there you go, up to no good I shoulda known it from the go
There you go all in the hood with every nigger rolling for
There you go, lying to me I know that you a hoe
you see I don't need ya, let them niggas feed ya, let them niggas please ya, yeah

[VERSE]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
That's why I ain't really tryin' claim bitches niggas who don't hanker give their game on the same bitches
That be the main bitches who say they loyal
Promise to do some thangs, kill for you
but make things all spoiled
Truly cutey-booty babe
But that ain't movin' now I got cred
I see from the door
she sure ain't shit
But you in love wit her
wanna go to the club wit her
and when you thug she up like a ordinary thug nigga
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O's preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H2O it ain't nuthin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe? But there you go

[CHORUS]
There you there you go, up to no good I shoulda known it from the go
There you go all in the hood with every nigger rolling for
There you go, lying to me I know that you a hoe
you see I don't need ya, let them niggas feed ya, let them niggas please ya, yeah

[VERSE]
Damn, what makes these hoes
wanna go
to the point where you can't fight 'em no mo'
so low that I hate 'em made 'em po po trick
I thought you said that you was through with that whole shit?
But now you back but you hopeless
You need to take your time and focus and see
what it really means to be a lady instead
givin' up the pussy, crazy
need to raise your fuckin' babies
so they don't grow up
with a mum's for a hoe slut
but all your dumb ass can say is so what?
Now there you go

[CHORUS]
There you there you go, up to no good I shoulda known it from the go
There you go all in the hood with every nigger rolling for
There you go, lying to me I know that you a hoe
you see I don't need ya, let them niggas feed ya, let them niggas please ya, yeah

[OUTRO]
That's the story
