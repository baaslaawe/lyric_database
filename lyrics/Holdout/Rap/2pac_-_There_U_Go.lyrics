There you go
Actin' like a hoe
I don't know why I be fuckin' witchu
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind
Times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal with
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggaz
I gotta blame my attraction but you became a distraction
A threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
Actin' like a hoe, actin' like a hoe
Hoe, see the word on the streets you're
Hoe, just a groupie on a world tour
Hoe, now I found out for myself you're
Hoe, girl you need to check yourself
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more hoes than me
So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O's preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H2O it ain't nuthin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe? But there you go
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
Actin' like a hoe, actin' like a hoe
Hoe, see the word on the streets you're
Hoe, just a groupie on a world tour
Hoe, now I found out for myself you're
Hoe, girl you need to check yourself
Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin' me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin' dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like, damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty and stop callin' while I'm workin' you hurtin' me
All this bullshit is irkin' me girl but there you go
I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
'Cause there you go, just like a hoe, caught in the streets
Like givin' yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin', so stop playin'
You hear what I'm sayin', you only good for parlayin
I'm layin' down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby 'cause I stay on the move
There you go
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
Actin' like a hoe, actin' like a hoe
Hoe, see the word on the streets you're
Hoe, just a groupie on a world tour
Hoe, now I found out for myself you're
Hoe, girl you need to check yourself
There you go baby girl, that's the story
There you motherfuckin' go
I coulda swore you told me you was gon' change
And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and
You wasn't fin' to dress all crazy no more and
You was gon' stay home and try to chill
What happened baby?
Oh, so yo' friend wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin' out 'cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
'Cause yo' friend wanted to get drunk?
It's all good, there you go baby
Oh I ain't trippin' on them niggaz callin' the house
It's all good, 'cause there you go
Me I'ma still be a player, all day baby
So uhh, there you go
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe
Actin' like a hoe, actin' like a hoe
Hoe, see the word on the streets you're
Hoe, just a groupie on a world tour
Hoe, now I found out for myself you're
Hoe, girl you need to check yourself
