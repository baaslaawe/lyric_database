[VERSE]
Who the fuck is this?
pagin' me at five fourty six in the mornin' crack a dawnin'
now I'm yawnin', wipe the cold out my eye
see who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigger Pop from the barbershop
told me he was in the gamblin' spot and heard the intricate plot
some niggers wanna stick you like fly paper neighbour
slow down love please chill drop the caper
remember them niggers from the hill up in Brownsville
that you rolled dice wit
smoked the blunts and got nice wit
yeah my nigger Fame up in Prospect
nah dem my niggers nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say dem,
they schooled me to some niggers
that you knew from back when,
when you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you blowin' up like nitro
and know they wanna stick the knife
through your windpipe slow
so thank Fame for warnin' me now I'm warnin' you
you got the mac nigger
tell me what you wanna do

[CHORUS]
Damn niggers wanna stick me for my paper
Damn niggers wanna stick me for my paper
Damn niggers wanna stick me for my paper
Damn niggers wanna stick me for my paper

[VERSE]
They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
wit the Texas license plate outta state
they heard about the pounds
you got down in Georgetown
now they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
they even heard about the crib
you bought your moms out in Florida
the fifth corridor
Call the coroner
there's gonna be alot of slow singin'
and flower bringin'
if my burglar alarm starts ringin'
what'cha think all the guns is for?
all purpose war got the rottweilers by the door
and I feed 'em gun powder so they can devour
the criminals try'na to drop my decimals
Damn niggers wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream things aint always what it seems
it's the ones that smoke blunts wit'cha
see your picture, now they wanna
grab they guns and come and get'cha
Bet'cha Biggie won't slip
I got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
so I can rip through the ligaments
put the fuckers in a bad predicament
where all the foul niggers went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck with what I had you with
you motherfuckers betta duck
I bring pain, blood stains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun he should've packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
so I can reload and explode down ya asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C four to ya door no beef no more nigger
feel the rush scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff the more dangerous
I dont give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you
I'm not runnin', nigger I bust my gun in
Hold on I hear somebody comin'

[INTERLUDE]
Shh
Come on motherfucker!
I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just bring yo motherfuckin' ass on come on!
Are we gettin' close? Huh?
It's right over here
Man, are you sure it's biggie smalls crib man?
Yeah i'm sure motherfucker come on
Oh fuck, it better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck?

Oh shit!
What? What's wrong man?
What's that red dot on your head man?
What red dot?
Oh shit, you got a red dot on your head too!
