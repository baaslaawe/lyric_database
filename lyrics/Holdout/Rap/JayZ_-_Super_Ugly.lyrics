[INTRO]
Uh oh
yeah
I got myself a gun uh oh, yeah, yeah

[VERSE]
I got myself a gun
Brooklyn, stand up
I got myself a gun
But really, I dont need the heat, nah
Ya heart pump project kool-aid ya sweet nigger
I aint gotta two-way you gays
This is not beef
This is rap homie
I don't have a scratch on me
You feel Jay soft
Rip jay off
Damn I'm only worth over a hundred million
Look
I got beef with like a hundred children
Niggers with pink suits faggot
Tryin' to get cute
You a little outta line homie
Don't let the nine homie
Put ya out ya mind homie
Bitch keep tryin' homie
Kick yo little lies
I kick my real facts
Like you sneakin' out the back
At the Source Soundlab huh
We wasn't chasin' you
We had a tape and too
We came through to do our one, two thang
It wasn't a rockefeller come through thing
If it was on like that
Why would I come through Queens
with Queens niggers know how I do
look, I got mo' shooters in Queens Bridge than you
Niggers'll tie you up on the Colloseum roof
And open beer bottles off ya boy's chipped tooth
Look Here

[CHORUS]
I got myself a gun uh oh
Yeah I got myself a gun

[VERSE]
Listen
I'm the J, the A, to the fuck this broad
This nigger never sold aspirin
How u escobar?
Had to buy you're chain back the last time u got robbed
The nerve of this coward nigger oh my god
And all rap rumors are innuendos
I bring them to you live
Lift up ya window
Let the public begin to see your dirty laundry
Ya'll don't want me to continue ho
haha, nigger? haha

[VERSE]
Me and the boy A I got more in common then just ballin' and rhymin'
Get It?
More in Carmen
I came in ya Bentley backseat damn
Skeeted in Jeep
Left condoms in the baby seat
Here nigger
The gloves is off
The love is done
Its whatever, whenever, however
Nigger one
And since you infatuated with sayin' that gay shit faggot
Yes you was kissin' my dick when you was kissin' that bitch
oh nasty shit
Crazy bitch
You thought I was boning Ranette
You calling Carm a hundred times I was boning her neck
You got a baby by that broad
You cant disown her yet
When does ya lies end?
When does the truth begin?
When does reality set it?
Or does it not matter
Gotta hurt that I'm ya baby mama's favorite rapper
And ask your current girl
She know whats up
Holler at a real nigger jigga
