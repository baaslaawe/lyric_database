[INTRO]
woo
yo yo yo yo
huh
Yo man glorious
This is protected
by the red
And Tical
Slap it down
Way out of bound
Roll in a towel
Fo' we gun down

[VERSE]
Yo, flipmode,
toilet bowls explode
When Doc come drop a shit load
Grip foes
Mushrooms, dick those
Deep pistol
Whip hoes
I bitch O's
Money, Roll, I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc escape row
Thirsty, snippin' out a pig nose
My Benz built wit wings and six 0's
My flows is North Pole cold
My hands got area's that fits snow
Doc, mixin' hoes in discos
My dogs let 'em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, Niggers pack six rolls
We're losin' 'em
His hart won't get pulse
Crack you bags off a Ten percent doze
Lip close, I could hum and shit cold

[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't

[VERSE]
I get scanned, rip sand
With this stick style
Pistol, lick ground
Get off my dick now
Kick crowd, hot style
You kids is docile
Timid, scared to get in it
These dogs is rock roud
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame
It's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows
You can feel yo
Kickin' in you do', like a steel
Go for real dough
Y'all gonna learn I spit germs
When you come shot on Big Worm
You gets burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done
And get sun, come get some
The last victim lie in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nick
Niggers chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get toxic
Up all the rightness
I'm chopstick
Go make your Wu just imposters

[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo yo, tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't

[VERSE]
You try to O K Corel
With Doc and Meth Tical
Bar saloon fight without weapons out
Stretch marks like Belly on Kevin Louse
On yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Try'na lock cash, bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jumpin', Meth shut 'em down
Pound to echo loud, bout Seven miles
Doc, dirty Jersey, hunt 'em down
Uncut rhymes, won't even fit your foul
Baddest man out the bunch, pick 'em out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch you mouth
Wilder then winos or liquor droughts
Mrs. how Mary Ann, dig 'em out
Ginger watch with the gun and skip a mouth
Love the ruckas and love to dish it out
Three watched M C's, start wristin' out
Get your whole camp put on the missile foul
Pushin' Twelve valve, bumpin' digital

[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't

[VERSE]
We just ice
Men of mice, ain't nothing nice
Fuck you like
Your tight is to light to fight
We move right, on fright night
When Niggers write
We bust pipe, condo's that suck tight
We all right, you all hype and war's right
In the Source, with half mic, you half liked
And half dead, blasted on glass bed
eyes red, the hash head
Burn somethin', earn somethin' and learn somethin'
Take my turn frontin'
Def Jam ain't heard nothin', yet
Suspect, ruffnecks
Buck 'em down or you get busted
Never leave home without my musket
Thrust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgement Day
caught y'all proud
Take M C's to town if they start blowin'
Ashes to ashes, they all fall ground
Master you bastards with hazardous tactics
semiautomatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in
