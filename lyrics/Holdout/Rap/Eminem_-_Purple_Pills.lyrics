[CHORUS]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[VERSE]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
And five I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These Shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D twelve throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
get her ass on the couch before she crashes out
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von
You see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cause the X is gone
Yeah I took 'em all down with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Young, dumb, and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit
I think I did too much uh huh
This substance equals cuffs uh huh
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills, that's ill
Mescaline

[CHORUS]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[INTERLUDE]
Dirty Dozen
eighty of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, i dunno

[VERSE]
Pop pills
Pills I pop
Pop two pills
On stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna, roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke
No oki doke
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
You're crazy!
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs
'Cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggers think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack
Then I might too
Swift, chill
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue uh huh
Speed, shrooms, down the valium uh huh
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon

[CHORUS]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[VERSE]
I'm at a rave
Looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline
Pencil legs wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill yeah right
Bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut!

[CHORUS]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
