[INTRO]
Look, I can see them niggers stuntin'
To this right now, not now, but right now
Yea, yea, ch ch yea, look, lo lo look
Look, lo lo look, look, look

[VERSE]
It's no love for the other side, fuck all the tricks
Pop the glove on the other side, buck through the bricks
Birds love how a brother ride, truckin' it sick
I'm heard of on the southern side, I pluck them quick
I been one of them boys since way back when
This is way before a nigger brought gray plaques in
So if I spray Mac-10's, bet you niggers lay back then
Like you sittin' in a Maybach Benz
Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla, do the damn thang money
I keep it comin' with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin' till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a goblet for me
I got them hoes starin' like they got a problem with me
I got them boys slingin' rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin' just a hobby for me

[CHORUS]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard, we don't love them hoes
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang
A nigger might grin but it ain't still funny
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang

[VERSE]
My phone is tapped and so is my livin' room what?
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room damn
Let me show you what I stand fo'
Jesus Schwarzenegger, call me commando
On that Remy Martin, nigger matter of fact
I ain't Fat Joe but I can make 'em lean back yeah
Save your ammo, don't waste it
Got him dodgin' bullets like he in the matrix
Jeans strapped and ya better dip dip
Carvin' fifteen, got six clips
Pillsbury nigger, got a lotta dough dough
Call me Boston George, got a lotta blow that's right
They place orders, so I bake cakes
I'm a bodybuilder, pump a lotta weight
You see the diamonds in my damn chain chain
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang

[CHORUS]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard, we don't love them hoes
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang
yeah a nigger might grin but it ain't still funny
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang

[VERSE]
You waitin' instead of participatin' with them boys
You skatin' on them twenty two, datin's like them boys
I'm hatin' that they communicatin' with them boys
I'm waitin' just to send them to Satan for that shit
They see a nigger stones look sick and I gotta stack
Of singles in my hand, that's phone booth thick
'Cause I'm so hood rich that I'm no good bitch
And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch
And get ridda that shit spitter, get wit her, shit gitter
Sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter
My style fit with her, I tell her you don went left
Now you need to go right like a switch hitter
I know them tricks bitter when I'm in the six with her
So I'm in a mix with her, forty four six with her
And I'm higher than a motherfucker
But a nigger try then he gon' die in this motherfucker

[CHORUS]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard, we don't love them hoes
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang
yeah a nigger might grin but it ain't still funny
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money
ey, do the damn thang, oh do the damn thang

Look l-l-look yeah y-y-yeah uh uh what w-w-what uh uh uh
