[VERSE]
Homeboys, well let me give you some to get dumb
dumb da da da dum
so move along and have some fun through static
I make you move back 
so you can ding a ling ding on that smooth track
so that's the way you got to go
so put your hands in the air when I said so
Just feel the groove a let the rhythm flow

[VERSE]
Well if you waited for my words to get on the floor
homies get closer what you waitin' fo'?
through static, the girl on the microphone rappin'
so now it's time to move amongst satin
homeboys are clockin' cos they know it's time
time to get back, and get what's mine
so now I'm back
I'm gonna get, get static
Make you move on my track automatic

[CHORUS]
feel the beat or we'll give you some to make you dumb
dumb da da da dum
Do ya feel that'll make you move and jump jump
to this groove 'till you feel the bass
and my lyrics aren't gone
'cos I'm back on the sat to give you some
and rappin' hoes are controllin' the beat 
yo DJ let's move those feet

[VERSE]
Through static
Yo I'm back on on the sat with Marty
and we're ready to party
so that's the way you all get loose
A super dooper trooper producer
so that's the sound 
ya got to deliver not la dee da dee
to make me shiver through static
this girl'll never sleep
I'm kicking in zyla
to keep the peace
'cos now's the time no time to waste
you wanna make a move well here's the place

[CHORUS]
if you feel the beat we gonna give you some to get dumb
dumb da da da dum
do you feel the beat that'll make you move then jump jump 
to this groove 'till you feel the bass
and my lyrics aren't gone
'cos I'm back on the sat to give you some
