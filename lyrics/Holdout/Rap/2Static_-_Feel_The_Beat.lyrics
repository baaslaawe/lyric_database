Here we are in the best years of our lives
With no way of knowing when the wheel'll stop spinning
'Cause we don't know where we're going
And here we are on the best day of our lives
And it's a go, let's make it last, so cheers you all to that
'Cause this moment's never coming back
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down, she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days we'll both hook up forever and ever
And here I am on the west coast of America
And I've been trying to think for weeks of all the ways to ask you
And now I've brought you to the place where I've poured my heart out
A million times, for a million reasons to offer it to you
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down, she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days we'll both hook up forever and ever
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down, she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days, we'll both hook up forever and ever
