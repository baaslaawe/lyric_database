There's a boy
His father's bad
He's sitting on the road
And he's so sad
Now he cries
Every day
Just tell him to forget about the father
Who couldn't show the way
There's a girl
Her momma's gone
She's got another man
And couldn't carry on
Now she cries
Every day
To forget about her mother
She runs away
How much do you love me
How much do you care
How much do you need me
When I'm not there
How much do you love me
How much do you care
How much do you miss me
When I'm not there
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
In this life
We live and learn
To lose what we love
And get what hurts
I'm not about
To forget it all
Gonna love every minute
Every hour more
How much do you love me
How much do you care
How much do you need me
When I'm not there
How much do you love me
