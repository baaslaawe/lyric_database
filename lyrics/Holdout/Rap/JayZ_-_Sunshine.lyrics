[INTRO]
What, tssh, y'all, what
Jigga, uh uh uh, uh huh
Pa pa, uh, pa pa, uhh
The G, Rockefeller y'all

[VERSE]
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Drinking saki, it's me, and my mammi with the doobie
Cutie, smellin' like Tiaka, half Phillipine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin'
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and A Z
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
Cause who's gettin' played is not me
Surely you jest, she said, if you thought I was purely
out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me
I said maturely, You right
but better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds
can move to the suburbs, I need to double-check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine, uh

[CHORUS]
Touch me with, a heart of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine ah ha, uh
Touch me with, a smile of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine

[VERSE]
uh, uh, uh
A year gone, and she seein' things most chicks only
hear in songs uh huh keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm that's right
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her abreast at all times, cats would love to creep uh-huh
just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggers stressin'
Hatin' 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you actin' like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be uh huh
One more thing
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me? Fo' sho'
She replied, eyes open wide Uh
Put that on everything? I put that on my life
Right

[CHORUS]
Touch me with, a heart of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine ah ha
Touch me with, a smile of gold
