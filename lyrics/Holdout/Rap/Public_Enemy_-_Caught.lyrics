People runnin' on empty, rock the sympte
Outside 2001, other side of the sun
Running, here we go tumblin', few solutions
Honey, they polluted the future, got me thinking of a new thing
Revolverlution, computer souls, controlled by confusion
You be clubbin' while the world around you crumblin'
Think it's funny? Bunch of crash test dummies
If all this shit means the end of my money
This is a stick up, off go the pagers and cellys
US Dollar, ain't worth what it's printed on
Backed by the Pentagon, sounds like Babylon
So I babble on, some of us stuck
In them barbershops and them hair salons
While the crash comin' at your ass
While the crash comin' at your ass like a bomb
Now it all comes tumblin', runnin'
Time is runnin', runnin' crash is coming
Break the bank, spinning since the beginning
Now it all comes tumblin', crumblin'
Time is runnin', runnin' crash is coming
Break the bank, spinning since the beginning

Willie dynamite, time to cry and no ice
Y2K, fallin' out of the sky, so it's chosen
Your ice is frozen, don't cry, dry your eye
Ain't this a bitch, fuckin' glitch. mother fucker what
The count down to my account, count it down
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, hush make that head bust
Last hour no control tower
Making new may flowers, fightin' new powers
Have you forgotten the other side of rotten
Picking electronic cotin' diggin' digital ditches
Lookout, lookout for the crash, crash, crash
Have you forgotten, have you forgotten
Y2K, that's the question
What the fuck is up got the 85 guessin'?
I told y'all for y'all protection, got me a name change
A pair of smith an wessuns, starring crescents
Mad packed with the lessons, figure 5 percent
Got the 10 counting blessings
Programmed by programs got you bowing to the man
Avoid collisions in mid air, medic aid and welfare
Zero, zero, what the fuck do you care?
All the lights be out, you can't get nowhere
All around, that's why I found Tony Brown
The world we know, it's going down, down, down, down
