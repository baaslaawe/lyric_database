[INTRO]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Twalib? Uh huh uh huh

[INTRO]
I know there's a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter than the perfect storm
That we weathering together and this the first time
That I've ever considered wedding rings but first things first yo
met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi-coastal
Thick like bi-focals, stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is in the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got a good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest to fly make you testify
Damn baby

[CHORUS]
I know we've got some haters and
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before

[VERSE]
You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening too
Don't get it confused ain't trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this it's like a miracle you
You you you, you stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I look above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
'Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo hear we go

[CHORUS]
yeah
s'go
I know we've got some haters and
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before

[VERSE]
You looked good when I tried you on so I had to write a song
Used to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and we never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone, why?
I'm never home scared of commitment ready to forever roam
We at war like Sister Souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to all the people see my name upon the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them dude you I don't care who she speaking with
'Cause I already know she made it clear who she's leavin' with
Yeah and it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie hoe, sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something and now you should know

[CHORUS]
I know we've got some haters and
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before

I know we've got some haters and
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before

I know we've got some haters and
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before

[OUTRO]
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
'Cause I never been in love before
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
'Cause I never been in love before
