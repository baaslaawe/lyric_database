[INTRO]
Uh
do do da do da do da do da do do da do da do da do da der do da 
Blaze one for the Brooklyn crew what
Blaze one for the Cincinnati crew yes
And for the whole world and for the whole world

[CHORUS]
Yo Hi Tek they still sleepin'
As a right we still peakin'
They still weakin' we adventurous thrill seekin'
We will begin new ways of freakin' it
It's the dawn of the M C who think before he spit
On Mission we intercept your transmission
Bringin' exactly what the fans missin'
You, bare witness to, the transition like
Gimme that microphone, man listen

[VERSE]
Yo, I literally
Obliterate M C's who rhymin' pitifully
Let's get it straight like degrees of longitude and latitude
Adjust your position like your attitude
Even cats frontin' had to move
Now let's begin shall we, while you testin' these better men
You get fucked up like it's your first Friday as freshman, uh
Letter man on the varsity team, I pipe dream
Make they cream freeze like reindeer caught up in high beams
Yo it seems that they sensitive like open wounds and I'm lyrically salty, salty
All your shit is faulty, faulty watch me turn jams into revolutionary parties
Stoppin' your heart piece, while we write soliloquies wit Sharpies
We stay in the air like aerosol to carry y'all
Over crept in M C's like Jerotol
We men in the mirror y'all, your career is like a metaphor for suffering
When we rush in, beat these niggers like percussion
You ain't touchin' nuttin' 
I give instructions and move on your weak production
Drop that African king shit and the royal flushing
Respect the queen, from straight from B K
Stick like girls' legs when they run the Penn Relay

[CHORUS]
Yo Hi Tek they still sleepin'
As a right we still peakin'
They still weakin' we adventurous thrill seekin'
We will begin new ways of freakin' it
It's the dawn of the M C who think before he spit
On Mission we intercept your transmission
Bringin' exactly what the fans missin'
You, bare witness to, the transition like
Gimme that microphone, man listen

[VERSE]
Talib Kweli it's the Reflection Hi-Tek
When we livin' this shit Out of the seven eighteen we meet the fifty one three
da da do da do da do da du
I blast through your illusions
Shatterin' your shadow as I snatch the light from you
When I want to uh, confusion is the conclusion you come to
That's the best you could come up wit
When your brain pattern is scattered and that's why you dropped that dumb shit
Which person will get hit next when I'm dispersing
Cursing me like ham 'cause I'm original when you're like the King James version
You need a surgeon to put you back together
When your parts is missin' like aquarian gospels
We can get real hostile without peace
Believe we balance positivity wit negative
Legal and illegal 'cause it's relative
If the law prevent me from being a man, then what's the deal?
In the Hour of Chaos, my microphone's my Black Steel
I grip it wit that sure shot feel
Drivin' through your mind, Hi-Tek be on the wheels
We ride up on your heels, don't look back back now
You pop more junk than a thane or bird
Fallin' flat on your face, you got caught trippin' off your words
Explain that sane lunacy
You oxy-moron, pimpled faced dummy goin' through puberty
Flippin' late night through cable channels lookin' for nudity
You're junior-high, what could you do to me
Nuttin' is new to me but I'm still learnin', what
Hip-hop is in our hearts and we On Mission from the start
To leave our mark up on this rock
Too many people is just livin'
Hip-hop is in our hearts and we On Mission from the start
To leave our mark up on this rock
Too many people is just livin'

[CHORUS]
Yo Hi Tek they still sleepin'
As a right we still peakin'
They still weakin' we adventurous thrill seekin'
We will begin new ways of freakin' it
It's the dawn of the M C who think before he spit
On Mission we intercept your transmission
Bringin' exactly what the fans missin'
You, bare witness to, the transition like
Gimme that microphone, man listen

[VERSE]
Listen man listen man listen
We intercept the transmission
Bringin' exactly what you fans missin'
Hi-Tek Hi-Tek Hi-Tek Hi-Tek
Uh uh, Talib Kweli yo
Exactly what it's supposed to be yo supposed to be yo
None of y'all niggers is close to me, yo close to me, yo
Step back before you get your head cracked head cracked
Yo steppin' to me you get set back, I never sweat that sweat that
Ey yo my man C Smith is jet-black jet-black
That's okay though, ey yo ey yo
I build these niggers up and then I smash 'em to the ground like Play-Dough like Play-Dough
And then I lay low I lay low
