[INTRO]
Marshall, sounds like an S O S
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fucking right!
To the rap mobile, let's go!
Marshall!
Marshall!
Bitches and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry step right up!
Introducing the star of our show, his name is
Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you
Marshall!

[VERSE]
You bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form flow, almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back!
Looks like Batman, brought his own Robin
Oh god, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his on private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pairs, plums, oranges
Yeah, here I come
My inches away from you, here fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine one one, so

[CHORUS]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town that shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town that shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah

[VERSE]
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willycores Dre, only bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to your loo, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to wait
Flows too wet, nobody close to wet
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say it hate it
On an eighties songs and
exaggerate it all So much
they make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rapping and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
C'mon, now!

[CHORUS]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah

[VERSE]
It's just like old times, the dynamic duel
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career russian roulette
And never even seen me blinging get me busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a M C who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Sandra be so leavy
Turn on these beats M C's dont see me
Believe me, B E T and M T V
Your gonna agree when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothing but clowns down here
But we, ain't fucking around round here
Yo Dre!
Whatup?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah

[CHOURS]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this
Must be a circus in town let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness
hell yeah

[OUTRO]
So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and grey

Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
