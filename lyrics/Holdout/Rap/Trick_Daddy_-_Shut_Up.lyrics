[VERSE]
Ridin' 'round in my brand new '99, 4 do' Volvo
I got a pocket full of Bs
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go though
But all my Boys they know though
That's fo' sho' though
Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?
Hell nah, you know they Polo
I been used again
Choosed again
This time been wrong to chop somethin' dumped by one of my Union friends
Soon as they seen the Benz
Hatin' season was in
Hell, 'cause they figured me for not understandin' their reason being
But I'm the man for this
While ya'll was doin' fine, I was doin' time
Just prayin' for this
Locked up, make a plan for this
Without all that fancy
Way too advanced for this
Just Polo socks, tanks top, and drawers upunder my pants 

[CHORUS]
Shut up

Lay down, playboy what's up?
What about the slugs in your head and your gut
What's up with the keys to the truck
Your lady say you got Bs in the cut
What up with the safe, what's the combo?
Open that, fuck all the convo
Say Shin, what's up wit ya Haitian
Party out, birds at the safe house, waitin'
What's up, why you strutted, D
I ain't 'bout, but a quarter key

You gon' bleed to death, you understand me
What's up
You ready to go?
You ready to tongue kiss with the new 4 4

Set your crime, ready to spray somethin'
Gun play, how I got the stripes
2 4 K turned out the lights
Gun play, how I got the stripes
2 4 K turned out the lights
