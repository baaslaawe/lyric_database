Ridin' 'round in my brand new '99, 4 do' Volvo
I got a pocket full of Bs
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go though
But all my Boca Boys they know though
That's fo' sho' though
(Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?)
Hell nah, ho, you know they Polo
I been used again
Choosed again
This time been wrong to chop somethin' dumped by one of my Union friends
Soon as they seen the Benz
Hatin' season was in
Hell, 'cause they figured me for not understandin' their reason being
But I'm the man for this
While ya'll was doin' fine, I was doin' time
Just prayin' for this
Locked up, make a plan for this
Without all that fancy shit
Way too advanced for this
Just Polo socks, tanks top, and drawers upunder my pants and shit

What's up with the keys to the truck
