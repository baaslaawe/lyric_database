[INTRO]
Amar, Amar, c'mon
Yeah Dad, what?
Hope you did your homework already
I did that already, c'mon Dad
Nah, it's time to go to
C'mon listen
What happened?
I went to school today I said AZ's my daddy, they said, Jay-Z? Nas?
What, what?
Tell me the story again?
Ok, ok
Aight, this is how it went down, here ya go

[VERSE]
We talkin' a few years before you even appeared
I was into my little gear, yeah
weed and my beer
Hustlin out of fear, fear of bein' a square
Like them cowards with no care
they just breathin' the air, son
clear, but didn't realize life ain't fair
with one drive-by, it could end your life right there
though I'm a fly guy from then
my knife's like chyeah
Fuck the world we can fight right
I don't scare
from beer
no more nightmares here
not a tear
I was strighter than the white man's hair
Met Nasir, he had that hype that jeer
Like a kite, threw me a mic
I took flight right there, yeah
that ain't lies I was nice I swear
went fool with the jewels, even iced my ears
New school, I was cool, wanted righteous wears
But from the door they didn't like that there, I ain't care
as long as I left the china white right there
and understood that you could change a life through prayer
it's all good
police even politely stared
Was unreal, but still now it feels slightly weird
I was spared
gave love, taught my peers
though it was rough, never gave up, fought my fears
Now it's like what?
I'm G'ed up, awesome blair
entertainer from the streets with a sportsman's flair

[INTERLUDE]
Yeah, that's good enough for you?
Dad, Dad, what's G'ed up?
Listen man, don't worry about that now, just go to sleep
Ok, ok
I'll tell you that later on
But you know what?
What, what what?
I got one more quick story to tell you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Maybe you could take this story, and tell your friends at school this one

[VERSE]
Here we go!
Out the gate, he who hate himself ain't straight
he a snake, he the type who send himself upstate
catch a case for a plate
he ain't have to take, he coulda
Played it safe, said his grace and ate
but it's fate
when a person makes certain mistakes
