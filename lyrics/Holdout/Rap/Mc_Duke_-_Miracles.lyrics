[VERSE]
Haha, back again, don't pretend
That you didn't know that the Duke could do it again
I came to make your brain awake
Cold like a lake, make you shiver and shake
Damn Damn I'm on the go
I come to cold get stupid and rock the show
And yes you know that I will grow
'cos the house gets warm just from my glow
See, I was born with a dope afliction
To write rhymes and rule the dictionary, 
so I make the whole crowd dazed
'cos I've learned that rhyme sure do pay
And not crime or petty larceny
'cos these rhymes I wrote for you and me
I'm on a chill tip cold gettin lyrical
And as the tune says, I believe in miracles

[CHORUS]
I believe
Make a miracle
I believe
Make the miracle
I believe
M C Duke is rockin, there's no pretend
I believe in you you you you you you you

[VERSE]
I'm on stage, no cage, 22 is the age
Educate your rage, so I'm known as a sage
My will top-bill cause I'm here to chill
A dope rhyme writer, not run of the mill
See, I swear with the blood that's in my veins
What they did before they can't do again
Cause the fight is on and we ain't wrong
So listen to the education in the song
No talk above your head cause the rhymes are dread
Won't bore ya door, no poll in z
Because the enemy happens to be you and me
Cause we was born B L A C K K, so hear what I say
They don't play, they got a death ray
I'm on a chill tip cold gettin' lyrical
And as the tune says, I believe in miracles

[CHORUS]
I believe
Make a miracle
I believe
Make the miracle
I believe
M C Duke is rockin, there's no pretend
I believe in you you you you you you you

[VERSE]
Not stupid, I loop it, better lookin that Cupid
Breakin out of any prison cause my posse can move it
Cause the time is mine and I know you're wishin'
That the government would stop black man dissin'
And a war is waged and the streets are paved
With the blood of the people that call me slave
This is a miracle, and so political
The style I use to fuse is lyrical
It's a pun for the words I use are too strong
And the pain is great I prolong
To make you understand what time it is
Check out I get it cause I know what rhyme it is
I know that we should take the time
To express what's in our hearts and minds
I'm on a chill tip cold gettin' lyrical
And as the tune says, I believe in miracles

[INTERLUDE]
Make make make make make make a miracle
Make make make make make make a miracle


[VERSE]
Where a child is born and the wind blows
What will happen tomorrow? Nobody knows
With the hammer of Thor and the power of mind
Cast spells with words and lines so fine
See visions of lands that are far away
Know what will happen in a year and a day
Be in two places at the same time
You see me on your television bustin' a rhyme
Annihilatin voodoo, the evil eye
If you gonna try and curse me don't even try
Get blood from a stone, then create a clone
So I still do shows but I stay at home
With the power of mind and a hourly rhyme
It's computerised and digital at D Design
I'm on a chill tip cold gettin lyrical
And as the tune says, I believe in miracles
The lyrics keep flowin right from my mouth
'cos when I'm rhymin this is my house
And like I said before it's a stone-cold habit
Pullin rhymes out of hats but never no rabbits
The D little lets and Leader 1
Just about to sign off cause the rhyme is done
I'm on a chill tip cold gettin lyrical
And as the tune says, I believe in miracles miracle miracles miracles
