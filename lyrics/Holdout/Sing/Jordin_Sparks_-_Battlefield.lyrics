[VERSE]
Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and
Suddenly it's like a battlefield
One word turns into a
Why is it the smallest things
That tear us down
My worlds nothing when you don't
I'm not here without a shield
Can't go back now
Both hands tied behind my back with nothing
Oh No
These times when we climb so fast to fall again

[CHORUS]
Why we gotta fall for it now
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield
A battlefield A battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield
A battlefield A battlefield
Why does love always feel like

[VERSE]
Can't swallow our pride
Neither of us wanna raise that flag
Mmmm hmmm
If we can't surrender
Than we both gonna lose what we had
Oh No
Both hands tied behind my back with nothing, nothing
Oh No
These times when we climb so fast to fall again

[CHORUS]
I don't wanna fall for it now
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
A battlefield A battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
A battlefield A battlefield

We could pretend that we are friends tonight
And in the morning we'd wake up
And we'd be alright
'Cause baby we don't have to fight

[CHORUS]
And I don't want this love to feel
Like a battlefield

Why does always feel like a battlefield
