You got me horny in the morning and you know 
I try to call you but I can't find the telephone 
I sent a message through the Internet but it rejected 
I wrote a letter and I sent it with the post 
The post it takes so long, so I've got to sing this song 
To let you know how I feel, what's the deal baby 
And I can't wait for you, and the things you make me do 
My heart is ringing so I'm singing this song for you 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight 
I searched from town to town but I can't find my bird ooh ooh 
I got so desperate I sent a rocket to the moon 
In New York City someone said they saw you singing the blues 
But it was a man from Nowhere Land who looked like you 
I will keep searching on 
This feeling's much too strong 
My heart is ringing and I'm singing this song for you 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight 
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight 
The post it takes so long, so I gotta sing this song 
To let you know how I feel, what's the deal baby 
And I can't wait for you, and the things you make me too 
My heart is ringing so I'm singing this song for you 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny 
I'm horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
So horny 
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight 
Horny, horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
Horny, horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
Horny, horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
Horny, horny 
Horny, horny, horny 
Horny, horny 
Horny, horny, horny
