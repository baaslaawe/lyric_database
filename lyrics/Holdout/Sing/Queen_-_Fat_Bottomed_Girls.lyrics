[CHORUS]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah down beside that red fire light
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Hey!

[VERSE]
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew love before I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me
Hey hey! woo!
I've been singing with my band
Across the wire across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
C'mon

[CHORUS]
Oh won't you take me home tonight
Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

[VERSE]
Hey listen here
Now your mortgages and homes
I got stiffness in the bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality I tell ya
Oh but I still get my pleasure
Still get my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you done made a bad boy out of me
Now get this

[CHORUS]
Oh you gonna take me home tonight Please
Oh down beside that red firelight
Oh you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round, yeah
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

[OUTRO]
Get on your bikes and ride

Fat bottomed girls, yeah yeah

Fat bottomed girls
