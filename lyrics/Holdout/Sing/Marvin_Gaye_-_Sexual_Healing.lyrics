[INTRO]
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight

[VERSE]
Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[CHORUS]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

[VERSE]
Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby
And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cos you do it right
Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

[CHORUS]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

[OUTRO]
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
I'll be feeling fine
