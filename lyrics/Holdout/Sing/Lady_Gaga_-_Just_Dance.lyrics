I’ve had a little bit too much, much, oh oh oh oh
All of the people start to rush start to rush by
A dizzy twisted dance
Can’t find my drink, oh man, where are my keys?
I lost my phone, phone, oh oh oh oh 
What’s goin' on on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can’t see straight anymore
Keep it cool. What’s the name of this club?
I can’t remember but its alright, a-alright

Control your poison babe
Roses have thorns they say
And we're all gettin hosed tonight! oh oh oh oh

[INTERLUDE]
When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call
I’m a hit it, I’m a hit it, and flex, and do it untill tomorrow yeah
Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down and
