[INTRO]
Yeah, all right

[VERSE]
I watch you walk away
Helpless with nothing to say, yeah
I strain my eyes
Hoping to see you again

[CHORUS]
This is my curse
The longing
This is my curse
Time
This is my curse
The yearning
This is my curse

[VERSE]
There is love
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you be there?
Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you

[CHORUS]
This is my curse
The wanting
This is my curse
Time
This is my curse
The needing
This is my curse, curse

[VERSE]
There is love
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?

[INTERLUDE]
Still I want
Still I ache
But still I wait
To see you again
Dying inside
These walls
Dying inside
These walls

[OUTRO]
And I see your face
In these tears
In these tears
And I see your face
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
