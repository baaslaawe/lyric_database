I watch you walk away
Helpless with nothing to say
I strain my eyes
Hoping to see you again
This is my curse
The longing
This is my curse
Time
This is my curse
The yearning
This is my curse
There is love
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you desire?
Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you
This is my curse
The wanting
This is my curse
Time
This is my curse
The needing
This is my curse
There is love
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Still I want
Still I ache
But still I wait
To see you again
Dying inside
These walls
Dying inside
These walls
And I see your face
In these tears
In these tears
And I see your face
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
