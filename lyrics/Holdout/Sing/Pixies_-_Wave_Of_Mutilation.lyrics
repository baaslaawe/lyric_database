[VERSE]
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away

[CHORUS]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave

[VERSE]
I've kissed mermaids, rode the el nino
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

[CHORUS]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
