[CHORUS]
Here comes the sun, do do do do
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right

[VERSE]
Little darling
It's been a long, cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here

[CHORUS]
Here comes the sun, do do do do
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[VERSE]
Little darling
The smiles returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here

[CHORUS]
Here comes the sun, do do do do
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right

[INTERLUDE]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[VERSE]
Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear

[CHORUS]
but here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right
Here comes the sun, do do do do
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
