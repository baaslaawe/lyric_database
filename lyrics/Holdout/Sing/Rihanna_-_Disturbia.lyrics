Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum 
What's wrong with me
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
WHy do I feel like this?
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
I'm going crazy now
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

[VERSE]
No more gas in the rig
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out my life, out my head
Don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you, uh huh
It can creep up inside you
And consume you uh huh
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

[CHORUS]
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' your call
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this sh out
It's too close for comfort, oh.
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you uh huh
It can creep up inside you
And consume you uh huh
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster oh
Put on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder City of lights
Ain't gonna play nice oh
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise be wise
