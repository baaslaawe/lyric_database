[VERSE]
One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube
And end up in your infection

[CHORUS]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[VERSE]
With eyes so dilated,
I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids

[CHORUS]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[INTERLUDE]
ah

[VERSE]
One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube
And end up in your infection

[CHORUS]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you
