[VERSE]
Ooh, I bet you're wond'rin' how I knew
'bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Dontcha know that I

[CHORUS]
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey well

[VERSE]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead I

[CHORUS]
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey well

[VERSE]
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Dontcha know I

[CHORUS]
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[VERSE]
Honey, honey, I know
That you're lettin' me go
Said I heard it through the grapevine
who oh I heard it through the grapevine
