[VERSE]
Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight

[INTERLUDE]
We spiral t'wards disaster
Survival fading faster

[VERSE]
Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Bleeding us to death
The new American dream

[INTERLUDE]
You're blinded by your hunger
Beware, your days are numbered

[CHORUS]
Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me
Guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

[VERSE]
Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on parade are stringing us along

[INTERLUDE]
We're on to your agenda
The dead-end road to nowhere

[CHORUS]
Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me
Guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me
Guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
