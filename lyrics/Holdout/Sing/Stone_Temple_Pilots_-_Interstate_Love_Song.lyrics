[VERSE]
Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
for what I read between the lines
your lies
feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
so do you laugh or does it cry?
reply?

[CHORUS]
Leavin' on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what I seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things you said to me

[VERSE]
Breathing is the hardest thing
to do with all I've said and
all that's dead for you
you lied good bye

[CHORUS]
Leavin' on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what I seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things I said to you
