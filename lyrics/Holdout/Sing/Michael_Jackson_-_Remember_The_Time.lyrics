[INTRO]
ho! Heh, I dounno, what you wanna try?
Every time you see

[VERSE]
Do You Remember
When We Fell In Love
We Were Young
And Innocent Then, ah
Do You Remember, ah
How It All Began
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
So Why Did It End?
Do You Remember
Back In The Fall
We'd Be Together
All Day Long
Do You Remember
Us Holding Hands
In Each Other's Eyes
We'd Stare
Tell Me

[CHORUS]
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met, girl?
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time, ah

[VERSE]
Do You Remember, ah
How We Used To Talk, Ya Know
We'd Stay On The Phone
At Night Till Dawn
Do You Remember, ah
All The Things We Said Like
I Love You So
I'll Never Let You Go
Do You Remember
Back In The Spring
Every Morning Birds Would Sing
Do You Remember
Those Special Times
They'll Just Go On And On
In The Back Of My Mind

[CHORUS]
Do You Remember The Time, oh I
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time, oh I
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

[INTERLUDE]
Those Sweet Memories
Will Always Be Dear To Me
And Girl No Matter What Was Said
I Will Never Forget What We Had
Now Baby

[CHORUS]
Do You Remember The Time, do you remember?
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met, girl?
Do You Remember The Time, oh I
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time, remember my baby
Do You Remember The Time, cos I remember
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time, all in my mind girl
When We First Met
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time, remember my baby
