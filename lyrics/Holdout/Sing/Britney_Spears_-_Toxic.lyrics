[VERSE]
Baby, can't you see 
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling
There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it

[INTERLUDE]
Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' round and round
Do you feel me now?

[CHORUS]
Oh the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[VERSE]
It's getting late 
To give you up
I took a sip 
From my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[INTERLUDE]
Too high 
Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[CHORUS]
Oh, taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[INTERLUDE]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[CHORUS]
Taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under toxic
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[OUTRO]
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
