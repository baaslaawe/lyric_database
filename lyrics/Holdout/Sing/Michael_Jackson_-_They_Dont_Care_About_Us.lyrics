[VERSE]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

[CHORUS]
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us

[VERSE]
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Do me, Sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, strike me
Don't you black or white me

[CHORUS]
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us

[INTERLUDE]
Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, no
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
You're rapin' me of my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy
Set me free

[VERSE]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody dog food
black man, black mail
Throw your brother in jail

[CHORUS]
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us

[INTERLUDE]
Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, no ah
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I do really hate to say it
The government don't want to see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[VERSE]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

[CHORUS]
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us

[INTERLUDE]
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah 
Some things in life they just don't want to see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no no

[VERSE]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, strike me
Don't you wrong or right me

[CHORUS]
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us we deep in fire
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us, I'm here to remind you
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us, don't you set that
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about
All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us 
he he
