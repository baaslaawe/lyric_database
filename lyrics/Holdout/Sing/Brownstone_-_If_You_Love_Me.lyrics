[INTRO]
Ooh yeah, mmmm hmmm
Yahoo hoo

[VERSE]
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare
You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

[CHORUS]
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it

[VERSE]
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go
You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

[CHORUS]
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
Prove it
If you love me say it, say it, say it
you want me, do it, do it, do it
Show it, show it, show it
Prove it, prove it, prove it
Say it, say it, say it
Do it, do it, do it
Show it, show it, show it
Prove it, prove it, prove it

[INTERLUDE]
Oh I, oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love all around you, honey
And if you come, you gotta show it baby
True love we'll share

[OUTRO]

Prove it, oh babe
Say it, oh baby
Do it, my sweet babe
Show it, my sweet baby
Prove it, my
Say it
