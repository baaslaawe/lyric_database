Yeah, yeah

[VERSE]
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady mercy won't be home tonight

[CHORUS]
Yeah, you don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Hey, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the western way, baby
Build your muscles as your body decays

Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall yeah

Your truth it's all the same yeah

Oh lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane

Baby now your struggle's all vain yeah yeah
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[VERSE]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

[CHORUS]

Ah, just surrender and it won't hurt at all, no
You just got time to say your prayers
Eh, while you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall
