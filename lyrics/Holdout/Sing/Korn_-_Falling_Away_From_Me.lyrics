Hey I'm feelin tired
My time is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's ok
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
The day is here fading
That's when i'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kills the pain
I can always say
It's gonna be better tomorrow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
Beating me down
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
It's lost and can't be found
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from, me)
Throw it down
Beating me down
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Twisting me  
They won't go away
So I pray 
Go away
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
F***!
Beating me down
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
(Falling away from me)
Beating me beating me
(Falling away from me)
Down, down
Into the ground 
(Falling away from me)
Screaming some sound 
Beating me, beating me 
(Falling away from me)
Down, Down
Into the ground
