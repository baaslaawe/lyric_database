[VERSE]
Hey I'm feelin' tired
My time is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's ok
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
day is here fading
That's when i'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
It's gonna be better tomorrow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

[CHORUS]
Beating me down
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground

[INTERLUDE]
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from, me
Throw it down

[CHORUS]
Beating me down
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me beating me
Down, Down
Into the ground

[OUTRO]
Twisting me  
They won't go away
So I pray 
Go away
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
