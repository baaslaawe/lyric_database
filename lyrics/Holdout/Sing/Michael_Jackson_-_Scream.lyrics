[VERSE]
Tired of injustice, ah
Tired of the schemes, ah
Live is disgusting, ah
So what does it mean, damn it?
Kicking me down, ah
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks baby

Peek in the shadow, woo woo
Come into the light, woo woo
You tell me I'm wrong, heh heh
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine, hah
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
With such confusions 
Don't it make you wanna scream, say you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me

Tired of you tellin' the story your way, story your way
