[INTRO]
wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa

[VERSE]
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man 'cause I like the abuse
Well, I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self esteem

[CHORUS]
Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[VERSE]
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till two then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

[CHORUS]
Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[INTERLUDE]
When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she saying, all men are like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess, I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care, right? Yeah

[VERSE]
Now I'll relate, this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know, I should say no, but
That's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

[CHORUS]
Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[INTERLUDE]
When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, all that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess, I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care, right? Yeah
