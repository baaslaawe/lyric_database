And you stare at me
In the Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carryin' a load
And you swear to me
You don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me
Like I, like I need to be saved, saved
Like I need to be saved, saved
In the Jesus Christ pose
In the Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
In the Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
I swear to you, I would never feed you pain
But you're staring at me
Like I, like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails
In the Jesus Christ pose
In the Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
Would it pain you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns?
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor
In the Jesus Christ pose
In the Jesus Christ pose
