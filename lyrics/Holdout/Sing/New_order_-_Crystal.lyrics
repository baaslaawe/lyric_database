[CHORUS]
We're like crystal
Hey
We break easy
Hoo
I'm a poor man
Hey
If you leave me
Hoo
I'm applauded
Hey
Then forgotten
Hoo
It was summer
Hey
Now it's autumn

[VERSE]
I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love
It's like honey
You can't buy it with money
you're not alone anymore
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core

[CHORUS]
We're like crystal
It's not easy
With your love
You could feed me
Every man, every man
And every woman, and every woman
Needs someone
So keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
