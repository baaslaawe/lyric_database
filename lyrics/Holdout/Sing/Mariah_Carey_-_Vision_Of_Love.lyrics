[VERSE]
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I belie yeah
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[CHORUS]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I realised a dream, oh yeah
and I visualized the love that came to be
feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I received
the answer that heaven sent down to me

[CHORUS]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be, yes
Mmm, hmm, hmm
