I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of being an ass
And I got a lot of nerve
That I'm ready to pass
I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of sadistic joy
My talent only goes as far as to annoy
I'm on my way
This is my
Main offender
This is what I've gotten in
And it got me sayin'
Why me?
I'm on my way
I get around
Not all too sure about what I do
Feel I've got to stop a second
Just to think it through
That's why I stop
I'm on my way
Yea, get around
Thought it all rollin' and now I spit it out
When I spit, I spit
I'm busted, I care less about
I'm on my way
This is my
Main offender
This is what I've gotten in
You got me sayin'
Why me?
I'm on my way
