[VERSE]
I'll start this off
Without any words
I got so high
I scratched 'till I bled
Love myself
Better than you
know it's wrong
So what should I do
The finest day
That I've ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do

[CHORUS]
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
I'm on a plain, uh uh

[VERSE]
My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do
The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do

[CHORUS]
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
I'm on a plain, uh uh

[INTERLUDE]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I tryin' to say

[VERSE]
It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do
One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do

[CHORUS]
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
I'm on a plain, uh uh
I can't complain, uh uh
