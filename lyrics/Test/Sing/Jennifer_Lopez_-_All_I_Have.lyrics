BABY DON'T GO
Yeah
BABY DON'T GO,UH
BABY DON'T GO
eah
BABY DON'T GO
BABY DON'T GO
Yeah,Yeah
alright
It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you're mistreating me
And it's crazy, but oh baby
It don't matter whatever don't phase me(uh,uh,uh)

I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WANT TO LEAVE LIKE THIS
I DON'T BELIEVE I JUST HAD MY LAST REAL KISS
I DO BELIEVE WE'LL LAUGH AND REMINISE
WAIT A MINUTE DON'T BOUNCE BABY LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS MAN
Well I'm bouncing and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good
Holdin' down my spot
and I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good 
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine right?
All my pride is all I have
PRIDE IS WHAT YOU HAD BABY GIRL I'M WHAT YOU HAVE
you'll be needing me but too bad
BE EASY DON'T MAKE DECISIONS WHEN YOU MAD
The path you chose to run alone
I KNOW YOU'RE INDEPENDENT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN
Here with me you had a home,oh yeah
BUT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WHY SPEND IT ALONE
The nights I waited up for you
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you
IT MAKES A CAT NERVOUS THE THOUGHT OF SETTLING DOWN
ESPECIALLY ME I WAS CREEPIN' ALL OVER TOWN
I THOUGHT MY TENDER TOUCH COULD LOCK YOU DOWN
I KNEW I HAD YOU,AS COCKY AS IT SOUNDS
THE WAY YOU USED TO GIGGLE RIGHT BEFORE I PUT IT DOWN
IT'S BETTER WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY COME HERE I'LL PROVE IT NOW
COME HERE
Stop playin'
you gaming
I gotta leave you alone
Cause I'm good 
Holding down my spot 
and I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good 
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine-right?
All my pride is all I have
PRIDE IS WHAT YOU HAD BABY GIRL I'M WHAT YOU HAVE
you'll be needing me but too bad
BE EASY DON'T MAKE DECISIONS WHEN YOU MAD
The path you chose to run alone
I KNOW YOU'RE INDEPENDENT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN
Here with me you had a home,oh yeah
BUT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WHY SPEND IT ALONE
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKE TO MAKE UP,TO BREAK UP,TO WAKE UP
COLD AND LONELY,CHILL BABY YOU KNOW ME
YOU LOVE ME I'M LIKE YOUR HOMEY
INSTEAD OF BEEFIN' BABY COME HOLD ME
I PROMISE I'M NOT A PHONY 
DON'T BOUNCE BABY CONSOLE ME
COME HERE
Ain't nothing you can say to me 
that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now 
And nothing will ever be the same
So just be on your way 
Go head and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me you ya know
I know your game I'm not feeling what you do
So I'm bouncin
and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone 
Yeah,Yeah
All my pride is all I have
PRIDE IS WHAT YOU HAD BABY GIRL I'M WHAT YOU HAVE
You'll be needing me but too bad
BE EASY DON'T MAKE DECISIONS WHEN YOU MAD
The path you chose to run alone
I KNOW YOU'RE INDEPENDENT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN
Here with me you had a home ,oh yeah
BUT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WHY SPEND IT ALONE
All my pride is all I have
PRIDE IS WHAT YOU HAD BABY GIRL I'M WHAT YOU HAVE
