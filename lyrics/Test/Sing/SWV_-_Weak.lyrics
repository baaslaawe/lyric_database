[VERSE]
I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[CHORUS]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me take hold
In a daze and it's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
