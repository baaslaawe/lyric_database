[INTRO]
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

[VERSE]
Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father have spoken

[INTERLUDE]
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

[CHORUS]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell

[VERSE]
Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
Through blindness

[INTERLUDE]
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams, dreams, dreams

[CHORUS]
We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the Children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell 
and Hell

[VERSE]
The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

[CHORUS]
We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the Children of a Lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell

[OUTRO]
We are the Kings
We are the Queens
We are the Kings
We are the Queens
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
