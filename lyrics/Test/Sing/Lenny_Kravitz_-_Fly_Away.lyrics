[VERSE]
I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high
Just like a dragonfly
I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas
In all degrees
To anywhere I please

[CHORUS]
Oh, I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[VERSE]
Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way or even Mars
Well it could just be ours
Let's fade into the sun
Let your spirit fly
Where we are one
Just for a little fun
Oh, oh, oh yeah

I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
