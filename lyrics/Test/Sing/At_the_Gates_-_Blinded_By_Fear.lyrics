[INTRO]
We are blind to the 
worlds within us
waiting to be born

[VERSE]
I cast aside my chains 
Fall from reality

[CHORUS]
Purgatory unleashed 
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed 
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All of your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears

[VERSE]
Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
Nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
The face of all your fears
All of your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
The face of all your fears

[VERSE]
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
A suicidal disease
The face of all your fears
Now covered with scars
Humanity exiled

[CHORUS]
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed 
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All of your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
