[VERSE]
Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other
Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future, hmmm
And some of us wonder
Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope, and a little trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

[CHORUS]
People hold on, ooh hoo
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on, ooh hoo
We've got to be strong oh
People hold on

[VERSE]
Everybody's getting frustrated
Why should we live with this hatred?
We've all dancin' on a thin line
But they're makin' out we're having a good time
So who's gonna give us the answer?
Sister and brother
Give a little life, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone

[CHORUS]
People hold on, ooh hoo
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on, hold on
We've got to be strong
People hold on

[OUTRO]
You're no good for me I don't need nobody
Don't need no one that's no good for me
You're no good for me I don't need nobody
Don't need no one that's no good for me
You're no good boy boy
Don't need nobody
Don't need no one that's no good for me
You're no good boy boy
Don't need nobody
Don't need no one that's no good for me
