Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a place a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dream that you dare to dream
Really does come true
One day I wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way upon the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way upon the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?
