[VERSE]
Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in the New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks

[CHORUS]
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
oh Mentally or physically
I wanna be in the New Orleans

[VERSE]
Oh good brother just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin' down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
but told my knees to please not knock

[CHOURUS]
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
oh Mentally or physically
I wanna be in the New Orleans

[INTERLUDE]
Do do do do do
do do do do do do
num num num num num oh yeah

Do do do do do
do do do do do do
num  oh yeah

[VERSE]
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my
So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was
Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest on the damn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky meters
She has one of those built in heaters
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

[INTERLUDE]
Do do do do do
do do do do do do
comin' on oh yeah yeah yeah

Do do do do do
do do do do do do
yeah

[VERSE]
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right

[CHOURUS]
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
oh Mentally or physically
I wanna be in a New Orleans
