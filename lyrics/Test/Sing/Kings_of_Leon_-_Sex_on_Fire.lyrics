[VERSE]
Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching
All the commotion
The kiddie like pain
It has people talking
They're talking

[CHORUS]
You
Your sex is on fire

[VERSE]
The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
while I'm driving
I'm driving
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
It feels like you're dying
You're dying

[CHORUS]
and you
your sex is on fire
Consumed 
with whats to transpire

[VERSE]
Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
But it's not forever
it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

[CHORUS]
and you
your sex is on fire
You
your sex is on fire
ah
Consumed with whats to transpire
And you
your sex is on fire
Consumed with whats to transpire
