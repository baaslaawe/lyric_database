Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching
All the commotion
The kiddie like pain
Has people talking
Talking
You
sex is on fire
Dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying
You
your sex is on fire
Consumed with whats to transpire
Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest
You
your sex is on fire
You
your sex is on fire
And so
Consumed with whats to transpire
And you
your sex is on fire
And so
Consumed with whats to transpire
