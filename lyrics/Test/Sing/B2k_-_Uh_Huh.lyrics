Two months of conversation
Man, this is a major
Spit tha game undercover
I'm lethal like Danny Glover
Got you runnin' to your mother
Makin' plans for life
Yo, I'm only fifteen, what I need wit a wife?
We can walk through tha mall while I hold ya hips
Or you can hang out tha drop while I'm pushin' tha whip
Take you on a ride you will never forget
Runnin' home, tellin' your friends, Lil' Fizz is it
Got ya hooked by tha way that I lick my lips
Then I got many dimes, I ain't sweatin' it chick
Yo, I run these girls from coast to coast
Drop the game so sick I got 'em doin' tha most, come on

[CHORUS]
