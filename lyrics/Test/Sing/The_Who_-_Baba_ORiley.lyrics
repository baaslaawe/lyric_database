[VERSE]
Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[VERSE]
Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south crossland
Put out the fire
and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older

[CHORUS]
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!
