[INTRO]
What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?
But you know I'm yours
And I know you're mine

[CHORUS]
Ooh, wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

[VERSE]
Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian
And you know I'm yours
And I know you're mine

[CHORUS]
Ooh, wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

[INTERLUDE]
Bang bang, knock on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' blue?
oh oh oh whoa

[CHORUS]
Ooh, wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

[OUTRO]
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
