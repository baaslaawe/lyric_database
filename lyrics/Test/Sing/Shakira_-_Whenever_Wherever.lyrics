[VERSE]
Lucky you were born
That far away so
So we could both
Make fun of distance
Lucky that I love
A foreign land for
The lucky fact
Of your existence
Baby I would climb
The Andes solely
To count the freckles
On your body
Never could imagine
There were only
Too many ways to
Love somebody
Lo ro lo le lo le
Lo ro lo le lo le
Can't you see
I'm at your feet

[CHOURUS]
Whenever, wherever
We'll meant to
Be together
I'll be there and
You'll be near
And that's the
Deal my dear
They're over
You're under
You'll never have
To wonder
We can always
Play by ear
But that's the
Deal my dear

[VERSE]
Lucky that my lips
Not only mumble
They spill kisses
Like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts
Are small and humble
So you don't confuse them
With mountains
Lucky I have strong legs
Like my mother
To run for cover
When I need it
And these two eyes
Are for no other
The day you leave
We'll cry a river
Lo ro lo le lo le
Lo ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

[CHOURUS]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to
Be together
I'll be there and
You'll be near
And that's the
Deal my dear
They're over
You're under
You'll never have
To wonder
We can always
Play by ear
But that's the
Deal my dear

[INTERLUDE]
Lo ro lo le lo le
Lo ro lo le lo le
We can fly
Say it again
Lo ro lo le lo le lo le
Tell me
One more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

[CHOURUS]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to
Be together
I'll be there and
You'll be near
And that's the
Deal my dear
They're over
You're under
You've got me
Head over heels
There's nothing
Left to fear
If you really feel
The way I feel
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to
Be together
I'll be there and
You'll be near
And that's the
Deal my dear
They're over
You're under
You've got me
Head over heels
There's nothing
Left to fear
If you really feel
The way I feel

[OUTRO]
Whenever, wherever
Whenever, wherever
Whenever, wherever
Whenever, wherever
Whenever, wherever
Whenever, wherever
