[VERSE]
Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine

[CHOURUS]
The seven seas of Rhye

[VERSE]
Can you hear me you peers and privy councilors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine

[CHOURS]
The seven seas of Rhye

[VERSE]
Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
Belong to you forever ever ever

[INTERLUDE]
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
I'll survive I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
Then I'll get you

[VERSE]
Begone with you you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile

[CHORUS]
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
