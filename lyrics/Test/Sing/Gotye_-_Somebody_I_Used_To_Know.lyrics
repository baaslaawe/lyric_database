Now and then i think of when were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache i still remember
You can be addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation ot the end, always the end
so when we felt that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad that it was over
[CHORUS]
But you didnt have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and I dont even need your love but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didnt have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[VERSE]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I dont wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
[CHORUS]
But you didnt have to cut me off
Make you like it never happened and that we were nothing
and I dont even need your love but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didnt have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
I used to know
that I used to know
