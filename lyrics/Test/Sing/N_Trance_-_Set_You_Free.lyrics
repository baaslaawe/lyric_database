When I hold you baby
Feel your heartbeat close to me
Want to stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free
When I wake each morning
As the storm beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free
Set you free
When we touch each other
In a state of ecstasy
Want this night to last forever
Only love can set you free
Set you free
When I hold you baby
Feel your heartbeat close to me
Want to stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free
Set you free
