I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art goes drown
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?
What follows?
All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send Gods grace tonight
Could it be found?
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?
I lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
I'll lay me down
I'll lay me down
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?
What follows
Will swallow whole?
What follows
Will swallow whole?
