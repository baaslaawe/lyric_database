[VERSE]
I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art goes drown

[CHORUS]
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?
What follows?

[VERSE]
All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?

[CHORUS]
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?

[INTERLUDE]
I lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
I'll lay me down
I'll lay me down

[CHORUS]
What follows
Me as the whitest lace of light?
Will swallow whole
Just begs to be imbrued
What follows
Has led me to this place where I belong with all erased?
What follows
Will swallow whole?
What follow
