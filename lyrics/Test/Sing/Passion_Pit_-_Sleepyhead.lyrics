[VERSE]
And you said
It was like fire around the brim
Burning solid
Burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed

[CHORUS]
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

[VERSE]
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors

[CHORUS]
Of your eyes but go in disguise like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

[OUTRO]
Your head
