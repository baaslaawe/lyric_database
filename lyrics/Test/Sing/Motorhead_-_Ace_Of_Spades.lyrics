[VERSE]
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man
You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say

[CHORUS]
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
The Ace Of Spades
The ace of spades

[VERSE]
Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you

[CHORUS]
Double up or quit, double stake or split
The Ace Of Spades
The ace of spades

[INTERLUDE]
You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it baby
I don't wanna live for ever
And don't forget the joker

[VERSE]
Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die

[CHORUS]
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be
The Ace Of Spades
The ace of spades, ah
