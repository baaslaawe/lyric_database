[VERSE]
Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me

[CHORUS]
I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more
Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around

[VERSE]
Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him
Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

[CHORUS]
Boys come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around

[INTERLUDE]
Yeah
Hard to handle, now
