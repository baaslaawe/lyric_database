[VERSE]
It was love at first sight 
I know from the way she looked at me 
Her eyes said it all 
Long days and nights, we spent 
Until she dropped the bomb on me 
When she said that she 
Was unhappily married with children 

[Chorus] 
And I wish I never met her at all 
Even though I love her so 
She got love from me, oh
But she still belongs to someone else 

[VERSE]
It hurts so bad, for sure 
Because she wants to be with me, oh
But she cannot be with me 
She chose to stay hey, at home 
So they could be a family 
For the children 
But what about me? 

[Chorus] 
And I wish I never met her at all 
Even though I love her so 
And she got love from me, oh yeah uh
But she still belongs to someone else 

[INTERLUDE]
Maybe in another life 
Things could be the way we both desired 
It's a catch twenty two catch twenty two 
Either way it went 
Someone had to lose 

[Chorus] 
And I wish I never met her at all 
Even though I love her so 
She's got love from me, oh whoa
But she still belongs to someone else, oh oh oh oh 
met her at all, at all, at all
Even though I love her so 
She's got love from me, oh
But she still belongs to someone else 

[OUTRO]
And I wish I never met her at all 
oh, I wouldn't hurt so much inside
oh, she still belongs to someone else
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
at all
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
oh yeah oh girl
she still belongs woo someone else
Wish I never at all
Wish I never yeah 
oh yeah yeah
