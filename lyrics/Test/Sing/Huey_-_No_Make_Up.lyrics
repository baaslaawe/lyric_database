[VERSE]
Listen
A perfect picture paint ain't it by jesus himself
five five brown eyes need nothing else
But a boss like me myself expecting
Nothing but some lovin' and request for me to be myself
Started off with just an eye wink
From that moment on I sworn that I
wouldn't let an eye blink
Very interested in what I think wat I think
Before I even got her I promised her
momma that she got me yeah
The drissi tight love wearin' dresses in
some six inch heels accessories
Nick name precious so precious
It ain't a chick out here to can face her
she's the top of the line a dime
without a smear of make up

[CHORUS]
She look so good she don't need no make up on
no make up, no no no make up
She wear that make up make up want to get up on, yeah

And I gotta make her mine she a bad broad
I gotta she a bad broad
I gotta she a bad broad

[VERSE]
yeah, and I gotta make her mine speaking truly
Face to her booty make me wanna do her
Though she did not do me have her dripping juicy
The smell of it's fruity threw the winter she fresh
But it's yellow as juicy fruit for her too be this cute
Her momma must be the truth but enough about your momma
Though momma can get it too you just hop into this coop
And I can show you what it could do
If you remove your pony tail I
guess I will remove the roof
And my carpets made of rabbit boo
you can remove your shoes
A hell of acceleration prefer you to move your jews
To bad he gone to jail cause I'll take you to jacob
And the only time I wipe make up is when we break up

[CHORUS]
She look so good she don't need no make up on
no make up, no no no make up
She wear that make up make up want to get up on, yeah
I gotta make her mine, I keep tellin' myself

And I gotta make her mine she a bad broad
