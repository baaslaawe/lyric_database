[VERSE]
Listen
A perfect picture paint ain't it by jesus himself
5'5 brown eyes need nothing else
But a boss like me myself expecting
Nothing but some loving and request for me to be myself
Started off with just an eye wink
From that moment on I sworn that I
wouldn't let an eye blink
Very interested in what I think (wat I think)
Before I even got her I promised her
momma that she got me (yeah)
The drissi tight love weren dresses in
some six inch heels acessories
Nick name precious (oh precious)
It ain't a chick out here to can face her
she's the top of the line a dime
without a smer of make up
[Chorus]
She look so good she don't need no make up on...
She wear that make up make a nigga want to get up on...
I gotta make her mine... (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
And I gotta make her mine (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
[VERSE]
And I gotta make her mine speaking truely
Face to her booty make me wanna do her
No she didn't do me have her dripping juicy
Smell of it's fruity threw the winter she fresh
But it's yellow as juicyfruit for her too be this cute
Her momma must be the truth but enough about your momma
Yo momma can get it too you just hop into this coop
And I can show you what it do
If you remove your pony tail I
guess I will remove the roof
And my carpets made of rabbit boo
you can remove your shoes
A hell of acceleration perferr you to move your jews
To bad he gone to jail cause I'll take you to jacob
And the only time I wipe make up is when she break up
[Chorus]
She look so good she don't need no make up on...
She wear that make up make a nigga want to get up on...
I gotta make her mine... (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
And I gotta make her mine (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
[VERSE]
She got me feeling like ooowwww...
We gone have fun tonight
Got me feelin like ooowwww...
We gone get it done tonight now babay
Wanna take you on a ride
Show you what it like inside
Sharing for everythang give me yo body pain
And I ganrentee when you give me your
body I have you punching and kicking like a myster
[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh oh
She look so good she don't need no make up on...
She wear that make up make a nigga want to get up on...
I gotta make her mine... (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
I gotta (I keep tellin myself)
And I gotta make her mine (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
I gotta (she a bad brod)
