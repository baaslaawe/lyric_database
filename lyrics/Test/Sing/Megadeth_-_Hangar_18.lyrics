[INTRO]
Welcome to our fortress tall
Take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

[CHORUS]
Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much

[VERSE]
Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military Intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

[CHORUS]
Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much
