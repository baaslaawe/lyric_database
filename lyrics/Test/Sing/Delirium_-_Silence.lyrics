I really wanted to go
It hurt me too much to stay
I run away so fast that my heart couldn't find the way
Then you came along and I was tired of my sadness
It seemed as though my life went on 
But the feeling didn't last
And then you came along
Everything is gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Then I knew everything was gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be
Lost and
Lost and
Lost and found
I was back on my feet
You could say I was barely walking
But the cut was deep
And I was holding on to past
And then you came along
Everything is gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Then I knew everything was gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be
He had stolen my illusions 
And I needed then so badly
I grew tired of my confusion
'Cause he was still there - everywhere
You came along and I was lost and found (lost and found)
My life went on but I was lost and found
You came along and I was stuck in my past
There was a new life in sight but I was blind
Everything is gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Then I knew everything was gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be
And then you came along
Everything is gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Then I knew everything was gone
Thinking my life is (lost and found)
Thinking I wouldn't ever get it done
It wasn't meant to be
It wasn't meant to be
