[VERSE]
Give me release, witness me
I found outside, give me peace
Heaven holds a sense of hunger, and I want him to believe
That I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides

[VERSE]
Passion choke the flower, did she cry no more
Possessing of beauty, hungry sin for more
Heaven holds a sense of hunger, and I want him to believe
That I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides

[CHORUS]
In this white wave I am sinking, in this silence
In this white wave, in this silence, I believe
I have seen you, in this white wave you are silent
you are breathing in this white wave I am free
In this white wave I am sinking, in this silence
In this white wave, in this silence, I believe
I have seen you, in this white wave you are silent
you are breathing in this white wave I am free

[OUTRO]
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
