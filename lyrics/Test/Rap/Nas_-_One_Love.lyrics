[INTRO]
Yo
word is born

[VERSE]
What up kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
But fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like yeah, shawty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with the niggers from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome piece
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones beach, it's bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs all the time
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nine's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say whats up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigger when push came to shove

[CHORUS]
One what? One love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[VERSE]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crack-heads stalkin', loud-mouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday, when I was walkin'
The nigger you shot last year
Tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'm a put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigger with he aks for the phone piece
Whylin' on the island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggers will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said, they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggers know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent ya flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' and four Maine, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated, your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love

[CHORUS]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[VERSE]
Sometimes I sit back with a buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinkin'
How can we exist through the facts?
Written in school text books, Bibles, etc
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed
So I be ghost for my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week
And hittin' Ls while I'm sleepin'
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin' terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigger up in Belle View
Or H D M, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helpin' shawty doowop
I roll two phillies together, in the prison we call them oowops
He said Nas, niggers cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin' when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted, he starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggers fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered, be the cool one
Tough luck when niggers are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
In a crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shawty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he could sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas
