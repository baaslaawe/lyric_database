Shit

Magic and banner

Body head nigger

[CHORUS]
Now we can take a walk to my truck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a duck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a ho
But I ain't got nothing
But, bitch, I'm doin' bad and I'm broke
Bitch, I ain't got nothing
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the gr gr gr gr grind ho
And I ain't payin' for shit, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho

[VERSE]
Bitches get a boot, I ain't trickin' all the loot
Sick of lyin' to them hoes, I'mma tell 'em all the truth
A brother doin' bad, buy your own fuckin' drank
Get yourself up in the club, stop reachin' for my bank
I'm a miser, that mean I'm tight as a jew
So if you're, lookin for love bitch you know what to do
Find a man, cause I ain't givin' nuttin' but dick
If you insulted Grab your fuckin pussy and split!
Callin' my phone, tryin to get in V I P
I'll get you in but my niggaz want some head for free
If you're, wit it I'm wit it, if you're not get the fuck ho
Thinkin' a nigga get you treated like a buck ho

[CHORUS]
Now we can take a walk to my truck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a duck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a ho
But I ain't got nothing
But, bitch, I'm doin' bad and I'm broke
Bitch, I ain't got nothing
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the gr gr gr gr grind ho
And I ain't payin' for shit, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho

[CHORUS]
Let me hold somethin' Banner, look you can't hold shit
Nigga buy your own drink, stop beggin' like a bitch
Get some motherfuckin' nuts, be a motherfuckin' man
Y'all them same niggaz laughin' when I step off in that van
Bootlegger cocksuckers in my face, you a fan, ho
Get up off my nuts and start your own fuckin' band, ho
Grab some fuckin' chalm sticks, get off of a nigga dick
Even if you had a pussy, bitch, I wouldn't splurge trick
Man, I'm comin' down hard, pullin' pussy niggaz cards
If you don't like it knuckle up and take it to the yard
Dead but you won't get a cent from me
But you can get a good ass kickin' for free

[CHORUS]
Now we can take a walk to my truck
But I ain't got nothing

And I ain't payin' for shit, I'm on the grind ho

[VERSE]
Now when I step off in the club, all the bad girls scream
Holla Boosie bad-ass, let me hit ya cup of lean
Told her no way, look like you before play
I hit you with this dick and I'm gon' make you run like O J
Now they got redbones, blackbones, horses and stallions
But if you got that fire cat who pal ya Boosie he ain't gone
You want your bread fire really you can get it
But we linin' like we dope and all my niggaz wanna hit it
I'm a fool in Mississippi, I'm lovin' the hype
Everything I drop it they gon' cop it like I'm Tina and Ike
I got a clique of real niggaz and we ready to fight
And we fo' sho' to hit somethin' at the telly tonight
I'm at the suites with two freaks, I'm slappin' 'em on they cheeks
I'm hittin' 'em from the back off a David Banner beat
Now I'm skeetin' on the sheets, headed to another city
Where we go and get some cat and we ain't gotta pay a penny nigga

[CHORUS]
Now we can take a walk to my truck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a duck
But I ain't got nothing
And I ain't tryin' to say you're a ho
But I ain't got nothing
But, bitch, I'm doin' bad and I'm broke
Bitch, I ain't got nothing
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the gr gr gr gr grind ho
And I ain't payin' for shit, I'm on the grind ho
I'm on the grind ho, I'm on the grind ho
