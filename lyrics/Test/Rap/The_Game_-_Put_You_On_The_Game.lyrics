First things first aftermath, the chronic is back
This is indo produced by timbo
Game over, naw the N W A chain choker
Is burnin' rubber inside the range rover
Chain smokin', purple haze, this ain't
Another one of those this the rebirth of Dre
The rebirth of L A, the rebirth of hip hop
Another memorial for makaveli and big pop
Hold up, timb stop 
I said this another memorial
For makaveli and big pop, g g g g g
Young homie got shit locked, public enemy number one
Flavor flave with the wristwatch all black g units
All black impala, im a skitzo three wheelin' the six fo'

In the backseat of the rover ridin' on dubs, nigger

Stunt on me I'll leave you wit your chest open, vest broken

Red dot on the glock, I'm goin' three times platinum dawg how

My unit is gorilla, fuck with my la familia, G unit
I will kill ya I know that boy not familiar,
But you got to feel 'em if the doctor sealed 'em
Is compton in the house? without a doubt
I'm the rapper wit clout other niggers yap about
You know the one that introduced New York to
The beach cruiser, got 'em puttin' red and blue
Strings in they g units

Tell em to keep movin', if I gotta problem wit a bitch
I let eve do it
unless she got on La Perla and I can see through it, I don't just let her ride
I give her the keys to it

In the coupe, I'm movin' in the neighborhood I ain't
Passin' through

But I slowed down and showed timberland how to iron a khaki suit

Show me where ya friends at we can flip that
Lemme put you on the game lemme put you on the game
Lemme put you on the game lemme put you on the game

Show you where they flip that, where they bitch at
Lemme put you on the game lemme put you on the game
