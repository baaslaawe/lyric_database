[VERSE]
Can I hit in the morning
Without giving you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if it wasn't droppin'?
If wasn't ah, eight figure nigger by the name of jigga
Would you come around naked, would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood an' kiss it could ya
See yourself with a nigger workin' harder than nine to five
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? so you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigger when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

It ain't even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my puss wet not dry like on damn clothes
What y'all niggers don't know, it's easy to pimp a hoe
these bitches best have my, money fo' sho'
Before they go, runnin' they mouth, promotin' half
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fuck so my god out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin' em feel, slutty even if they don't want it
It's been so long
Since I met a chick ain't on my tips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em be gone
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and platinum
Cause from now on, you can witness ja the icon
With hoodies and timbs on, cause I thugs my bitches
Veve, studs my bitches, we raw bitch niggers
I'm talkin' bout straight figures if you here get wit us
If not boo, you know what, I still fuck you
