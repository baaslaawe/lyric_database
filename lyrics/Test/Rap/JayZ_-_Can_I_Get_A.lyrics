Would you ride then, if it wasn't droppin?

Would you come around naked, would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on mydick, kiss it - could ya
See yourself with aniggaworkin harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? so you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with aniggawhen his dough is low
