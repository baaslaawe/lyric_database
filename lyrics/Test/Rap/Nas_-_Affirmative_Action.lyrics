[VERSE]
You sit back relax catching contacts sip your cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack, a new cat is back worth top dollar
In fact touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gun point
Catch 'em and break undress 'em tie 'em with tape, no escape
The corleone fettucini capone room in your won zone
Get kidnapped and clapped in your dome, we got it sewn
The firm art of war is unknown, lower your tone face it
Homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats politician daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack lex coup tripple black
Criminal thoughts in the blue porsche
My destiny is to be the new boss
my nigga pauly got a die he's too soft
That nigga is dead on
A key of heroin
They found his head on
The couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killas since bugsy
Bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be
I wear guess jeans and rugbies
Yo my people from medina they will see you
When you're up on your heater all your cream go betweeen us
Real shit
My dearest eagle got an ill grip
I chill with
Niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My reb beam, made a Dread scream
And sprayed fed team
Co be turnin' niggas to fiends
Ukon and ninja block lixius
Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections its the firm nigga
Set in
Yo, my mind is seeing through design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sippin' on crusted grapes
We lust papes and push cakes inside the casket at just's wake
It's sickening, he just just finish bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it is nobody that's in my clique
My man smoke know how to expand coke
And mr. coffee
Feds cost me 2 mil to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God forbid the bitch divorse me
I be flooded with ice or hell fire kid scorch me
Cuban cigars meetin Foxxy at the mars, movin' cars
Your top pockets Sr. Escobar
In the black camaro
Firm deep all my niggas hail the black esparo
Wallabees be the apparel
Throughout the Darkest tunnels
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
Money bags got moet shan dor bundle
In 62 they ain't clue what we about to do
My whole team we shittin' hard like czar
Sosa, Foxxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquis piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters carolina herarra
Be the firm baby, from BK to the bridge
My nigga wiz operation firm biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jewel sippin Crist-ies
Sittin on top of 50 grand in Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni like all the thug niggas in mosey
The gods they precise allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on
My whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Islands with a case of Cristal
Papa chula spoke, nigga with them cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though
Flippin the bigger picture
The bigga nigga with the cheddar
Was mad jipper, he had a fucker villa in manilla
We got the fleet of Panama
But wait it's half and half
Keys is one and 2/5 is how we flip
32 grams raw chopped in half get 16
Double it times 3 we got 48 which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the prophet by 4 subtract it by 8
We back to 16, now add the other two tha mega bringin through
So let see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred
Cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times 3
We got three-fourths of another key
The Firm baby, volume one uh!
