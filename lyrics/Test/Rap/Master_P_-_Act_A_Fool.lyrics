Still posted on the block, still slangin' that coke
Still runnin from the cops, still lettin' 'em bitches know
Still fuckin' with your made, beause blowin' that ganja
Uptown New Orleans is where them thugs gonna find me
Rolling with 'em head bustas, my niggaz splitting wigs
A couple fucking G's nigga it can get did
Straight from the hood and I represent the street
Send money to the pen, still fucking with C
(Okay!)
R.I.P. to the niggaz in the motherfucking dirt
When I look into their momma's eyes I still see the hurt

Put the bullets in the can and let that motherfucker pop

Thug girls, I put my name on them
Me and Jon's like the Lakers
Going for three rings in the game on them
We ain't done till it's a dun-dadda
And I got my own clothing and so fuck Gucci and Prada nigga
I'm underrated like Sam Cassell
But when the playoffs come nigga I'ma be there
Can't fall off because a nigga ain't average
Fuck the I.R.S. a nigga still got cabbage
Know how to play the game because the nigga is a baller
Lil Jon with the beat and now them hoes wanna call ya
I ain't Michael Jackson the P won't quit
I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6

I still walk through the hood by motherfucking myself
And if I have some beef nigga I don't need know help
Nigga ain't Puffy and a nigga ain't Maize
So give me 50-feet before I catch a fuckin' case, nigga
We ain't going to the Grammys
Find us on the block posted up slangin' motherfucking wammies
Still thuged out with the white tees fuck-a-nigga who don't like me
I got nine biscuits for the dog that try to bite me
I'm still rowdy, nigga I'm still bouty
Still got them bouncing in the clubs
And 'em hoes still talk about me
Ten years later nigga I'm still in the game
Y'all thought after 400$ mill a nigga would change?
