[INTRO]
H to the izzo 
V to the izzay
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century
oh it's timeless
hove!
Thanks for comin' out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here wit me
I appreciate that
uh

[VERSE]
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V A
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin' 'em
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D A wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof vamoose, son of a bitch

[CHORUS]
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V A
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up

[VERSE]
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

[CHORUS]
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V A
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up

[VERSE]
Hove is back, life stories told through rap
Niggers actin' like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs no, Hove did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
What else can I say about dude, I gets busy

[CHORUS]
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V A
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
uh huh huh huh huh huh huh
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
H to the izzo, V to the izzay
