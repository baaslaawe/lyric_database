It ain't wrong to feel so strong when you think you got it going on
Life has a way of making you pay to the club where we all belong
Now you're free to believe that the good life is guaranteed
But watch your step 'cause it's a safe bet you're gonna end up on your knees
Chorus 
You're gonna get spanked 
I'm warning you sister 
You're gonna get spanked 
Life's gonna hit you 
You'll never know until you get, Spanked 
You're gonna be humbled 
You're gonna get spanked 
And you're world's gonna crumble 
You'll never know until you get spanked...

Some do want to prove that there are really just a chosen few 
So to test your fate, speculate that it can never really happen to you 
I've been high, at least tried, I learned to sleep with an open eye 
You crossed that line, better take the time to kiss your ass goodbye
(Chorus)
When you're so sure you got it right
All alone in the spotlight 
You'll never see it coming
(Chorus)
