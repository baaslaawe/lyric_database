[INTRO]
And I'm serious about mine, I'm so sincere
And I, nigger I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up
Put ya inside the mattress like drug money nigger
Yeah, I done told you niggers
nine or ten times stop fuckin' with me stop fuckin' with me
I done told you niggers
nine albums, stop fuckin' with me stop fuckin' with me
I done told you niggers
The nine on me, stop fuckin' with me stop fuckin' with me
You niggers must got nine lives got nine lives
ninth wonder

[VERSE]
Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya
Am I frightenin' ya?  Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out
the technique from the two tecs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical I conductin'
You lookin' at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic
I don't care if you C Delores Tuck it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin' me up
For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred
I'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You never had me like Christina Aguilery
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the F D R, in the seat of my car
Screamin' out the sunroof death to y'all
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin' to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' bout Feds
Nigger them body-snatchers, nigger you heard what I said

[CHORUS]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigger stop fuckin' with me
R I P

[INTERLUDE]
That's right there nigger, nigger I'm wild
Nigger I keep trash bags with me
Never know when you gotta dump a nigger out
This sincere, this some sincere shit right here

[VERSE]
Grown man I put hands on you
I dig a hole in the desert, they build The Sands on you
Lay out blueprint plans on you
We Rat Pack niggers, let Sam tap dance on you
Then, I Sinatra shot ya God damn you
I put the boy in the box like David Blaine
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang
Y'all wish I was frontin', I George Bush the button
Front of all you in your car lift up your hood niggers run it
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it
Your boy got the goods y'all don't want nuttin' of it
Like, castor oil, I Castor Troy you
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you change all that for you
y'all niggers is targets
Y'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it
in your upper level, valet a couple strays
from the thrity eight special, nigger, God bless you


[CHORUS]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigger stop fuckin' with me
R I P

[INTERLUDE]
Yeah I'm threatening ya, yeah I'm 

[VERSE]
L I
I'm the one, thus meanin' no one must try
No two, no three, no four, know why?
Because one's four five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I 'splay the seven
Put you on the nigger news, U P N at eleven
Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm that I'm
that I'm so sincere?
I'm especially Joe Pesci with a grin
I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again
That's right

[CHORUS]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigger stop fuckin' with me
R I P

What up?  Motherfucker I keep three motherfuckers what?
Nigger I'll throw a Molotov cocktail through your momma's momma's house
Nigger what the
