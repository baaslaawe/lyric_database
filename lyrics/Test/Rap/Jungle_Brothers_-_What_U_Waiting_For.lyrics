[INTRO]
yeah
oh yeah
like the way this is goin'
damn word
ah huh
yeah
I think we need a little somethin' extra
say what's that?
Yeah I think that's it
Uncle Sam?
We gonna have a god time tonight
ha ha ha ha
Got on my shoes, got on my shirt

[VERSE]
Come on!
Jump up freak a hustle
Do what you want but move every muscle
Ain't no time for playing around
Only one thing to do when you hear this sound
Act yourself with someone else
And make sure yourself ain't by yourself
Dyin' to get on the dance floor
Girl what you waiting for? yeah
Come on over and swing with me c'mon
take your mind out yo' misery woo
Tomorrow's gonna be another day uh huh
Tonight, I'm gonna take it life yeah
Grab the world and put it on hold word
Relax my body and rest my soul
Feel the vibe surrounding me uh
Feel the bass come down on me yeah
Shake your butt but don't break your back
Tap your feet and let your fingers snap
No matter what size shape or colour
We can jam and enjoy each other
Music's pumpin' I feel something
Must be my blood and heartbeat thumpin'
Dispense your funds to pass through the door
You know there's room for you on the floor
You don't know if they'll be any more
So yo, what you waiting for?
