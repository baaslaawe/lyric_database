[INTRO]
Young Thugs in this motherfucker

[VERSE]
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
hahaha
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggers wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigger I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggers ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps
Loadin' my sperm wrapped in my sheets
Don't make enemies with me

[CHORUS]
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me, nigger
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

Don't make enemies with me

Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

[VERSE]
The game is getting deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminiscin'
And having flashbacks when them niggers came up missing
Wish in my heart, these niggers they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court They don't really wanna start
How you wanna do? Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay sipping on my array to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime
yeah nigger
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting
hahaha
'Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggers is fronting
Do you really want it? niggers dying

[CHORUS]
Don't make enemies with me
hahaha
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

[VERSE]
Now, we're in ninety four, Niggers get bust through the do'
Cup in a flash sittin' on that ass and rarely fold
Galitter tell 'em bout that trife shit You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch be-atch!
A nigger struggle too hard for what I got
hustle and doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I couldn't see it
Facing a century in the penitentiary but so be it
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait No time for stalling but death is calling
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling
True, what I do from sun up is for a come up
Wake up with my gun up Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake G's  You know how we do

[CHORUS]
Don't make enemies with me 
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little G's
Don't make enemies with me, nigger hahaha
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd Rather fuck with these other other little G's
