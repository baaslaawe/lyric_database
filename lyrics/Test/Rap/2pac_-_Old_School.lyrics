[INTRO]
Here we go
we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
ya know what I'm sayin Nuttin' but love for the old school
That's who we gonna do this one for, ya feel me?
Canned go, and B V D's an' shit
heh
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[VERSE]
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
and Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
when De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, K R S to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school

[CHORUS]
nuttin' like the old school
nuttin' like the old school
yeah heh, it ain't nuttin' like the old school
nuttin' like the old school
the old school
heh

[VERSE]
Heheh I had, Shell Toes, and B V D's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the tray bag
I'm on the train headin' uptown, freestylin'
with some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, Why them niggaz swearin?
I'm wonderin' if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin' up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin' to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin' nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin' 90 proof, ain't nuttin' like the old school

[CHORUS]
nuttin' like the old school
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[INTERLUDE]
Hey rich, ain't nuttin' like the motherfuckin' old school nigga
An' I know you kinda like reminiscing when I just freak it to you like that, so why don't you flip that shit for these mutherfuckers an' like, you know, really just let me them see how you picture the old school
'cause it ain't the same for every motherfucker, you feel me? So, er, take us back nigger

[VERSE]
remember poppin' and lockin' to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di
Gamin' the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remember
breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, L L when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the T V, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school!

[CHORUS]
it ain't nuttin' like the old school
haha
it ain't nuttin' like the old school
hey, on the real though
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[OUTRO]

Remember seein' Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
and motherfuckers would lose they god damn mind
