[INTRO]
Hello
No doubt
Oh wa
To the german
Queen shit
Beatnuts y'all

[VERSE]
Ayo, its ill when i'm heated how my heart stay cold 
write a rhyme that make the gas around a map explode
now behold the burning malice of a treacherous soul
first time I shot a gun Luke, I was twelve years old
But since then, I've never put it down my friend
she go to war when I tell her
fuck a who, why, when, till the end
indeed its good to have and not need
even better when you can shoot back and not bleed
take heed, poppin' like a L full of C
my team is gettin' bigger, got more mouths to feed
Shorty let me tell you bout my only vice
it got to do with lots of money and it ain't nothin' nice
it ain't nothin' nice

[CHORUS]
Ay, you believe in God?
you do, tell him to save you
'cause me and these fellas here
we aint tryin' to pay you
regardless of the fact that it's close to home
we gotta finish your life, so we can start our own
believe in God?
you do, tell him to save you
'cause me and these fellas here
we aint tryin' to pay you
regardless of the fact that it's close to home
We gotta finish your life, so we can start our own
Our own, baby

[VERSE]
Ayo, my audios guaranteed to lift the audience
it was that time again
so we gathered up fourty men
fourty ounces, trees burnin', heads bouncin'
balance is the mission
sittin' in the yoga position
isolate my mind from your bitchin'
pulp fiction
lose you in the mix in
lets get this poppin' , lock down the top ten
knock these pretty boy cats on they ass each time we drop kid
yeah, you know how we comin'
raw grooves with the funky drunk drummin'
and when my song goes off
you'll still be hummin'
noddin' your head, or singin' my chorus
the after midnight theme
the four in the morning blunt theme
peelin' dutches
fill 'em in like taco shells
willing judges
wheeling jake with half a cake in my coat
pointin' gats like remotes
at cats for their federal notes
splash
tossin' bodies off boats

[CHORUS]
Ay, you believe in God?
you do, tell him to save you
'cause me and these fellas here
we aint tryin' to pay you
regardless of the fact that it's close to home
we gotta finish your life, so we can start our own
believe in God?
you do, tell him to save you
'cause me and these fellas here
we aint tryin' to pay you
regardless of the fact that it's close to home
We gotta finish your life, so we can start our own
Our own, baby, our own
