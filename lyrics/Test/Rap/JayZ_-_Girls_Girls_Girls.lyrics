Holler at ya when I come off tour, woo

[VERSE]
Got this smarty art chick to hold my posters question
I read a couple books to add to a soul's progression
To put this in layman's terms I gave her some knowledge
she gave me brains in return she had to drop outta college
n'all she does is homework, I give her in-house tutoring
in-an-out of movin' through her student body union and she
call me professor say daddy come and test her
so she can fail on purpose and repeat the semester, I'm like
at this rate I might never graduate, she said
I ain't no fool I'mma make it up at summer school

[CHOURS]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
now let the people sing
Girls I, just tryin' girls out
Just tryin', girls
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

[VERSE]
who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
who said what, why you trippin' girl? why's you fussin'?
Got this model slash actress slash part-time waitress
been a whole day she hangin' round wit part-time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since tend to very I tend to carry
more rumours than ten Mariah Carey's
Tend to harry's and ten places at once
plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines, my 
time together as a time together and a, time apart is a time apart
to love J wit ya mind, girl and not ya heart
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around
like the late Macavelli or Perelli twenty inches of cane an' old dogs stick up tape for minutes 
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my business

[CHORUS]
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I get off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

[VERSE]
I'm lookin' for, southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
big ghetto booty, scarf over doobie
Chanell under the louie, Gucci over booty
Vicki covered titties, attitude of the city
pretty, witty, girly, whirly
one who likes to party but come home early
light kinda dark, short sorta tall
slim, kinda thick I swear I love 'em all
she can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
but she can get you first class seats for coach prices
isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight
her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

[CHORUS]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
holler at ya when I get off tour
girls, girls, girls, girls
girls I do adore
yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
holler at ya when I come off tour
