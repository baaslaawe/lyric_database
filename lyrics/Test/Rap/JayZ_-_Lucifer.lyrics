[INTRO]
woo!

[CHORUS]
uh uh uh uh 
you see, you see, you see?
I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital
you see, you see, you see, you see?
Kanyeeze you did it again, you're a genius nigger!
So you niggers change your attitude
'fore they asking what happened to you

[VERSE]
Lord forgive him
He got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them a murder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performing procedures
Jesus
I ain't trying to be facetious
But vengeance is mine said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggers on death's door
Breathing off respirators
for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz
Flya the Sanna Lathan
Pumping Brown Sugar by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles
Like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your ties being good Catholics
I'm coming

[CHORUS]
uh uh uh uh 
you see, you see, you see?
I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital
you see, you see, you see, you see?
you see, you see?
So you niggers change your attitude
'fore they asking what happened to you

[Verse]
Yes
This is Holy war
I wet you all with the Holy water
Spray from the Hetckler Koch auto
Matic all the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw a couple at you
Take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I'll pour out a little Louie 'til I head above
Yes Sir
And when I perish
The meek shall inherit the earth
'til that time it's on a poppin' Church
Like Don Bishop
The fifth upon cock either
Lift up your soul or give the Holly ghost please
I leave ya in somebody's Cathedral
And stuntin' like Evil Kenevil
I'll let you see where that bright light leads you
The more you talk the more you irking us
The more you gonna need memorial services
The Black Albums second verse is like
Devil's Pie save some dessert for us

[INTERLUDE]
Man I gotta get my soul right, uh
I gotta get these Devils out my life, uh
These cowards gonna make a nigger ride, uh
They won't be happy 'til somebody dies, uh
Man I gotta get my soul right, uh
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life, uh
Everytime it seems it's all right, uh
Somebody want they soul to rise
I'll chase you off of this Earth

[VERSE]
I got dreams of holding a Nine milla
To Bob's killer
Aksing him why? as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten Holmes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your Church mass
Reverse the crash
Reverse the blast
And reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are
Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the sun of the mourning
Thanks Again
