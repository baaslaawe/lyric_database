LabROSA Lyrics / Audio Repository
=================================

This is the documentation for LYRICAL: the Labrosa repositorY of Recorded Information Concerning Audio and Lyrics. Contained within are the lyrics to popular music tracks, annotated at the structure level (verse, chorus etc.) with accompanying acapella and polyphonic audio. 

The database is intended to be used for providing a common dataset for Automatic Lyric Transcription (ALT). Also contained within are therefore scripts for reproducing our baseline ALT performance using the Sphinx4 Automatic Speech Recognition system.

Installation
============

The easiest way of getting the lyrics is to say:

git clone https://github.com/mattmcvicar/lyric_database.git

Lyrics
------
The database is split into two disjoint subsets: "Train" and "Test", and two genres: "Rap" and "Sing". The "Train" set is to be used for training or adapting acoustic or language models, the test set reserved for evaluation. We believe the acoustic and language models for rapped and sung audio to be quite different, so have kept them distinct. 

Each file is written in plain text, with each line being one of:
  
  - annotation line
  - lyric line
  - empty line

Annotation lines are enclosed within square brackets and contain structural information. lyric lines contain the lyrics to the song, made up of the lower and upper-case letters of the latin alphabet, together with the following punctuation set: 

,!?'-

(commas, exclamation marks, questions marks, single quotes and hyphens). Empty lines are used purely for aesthetic purposes. Example file snippet (first verse of "30_Seconds_to_Mars_-_The_Kill.lyrics"):

-----------------------------------
[VERSE]
What if I wanted to break
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do? Oh, oh oh oh
What if I fell to the floor
Couldn't take all this anymore
What would you do do, do do, do do?
-----------------------------------

Resources
---------
Since the database contains a considerable amount of slang, we also include a file 

resources/Train_Test_Holdout.dict

which contains pronounciations from the CMU set of 39 unstressed phonemes for each word in the train, test, and holdout sets. These are not used in our baseline experiments (many will most likely not be in standard language models) except in evaluation, but will be essential in training new language models. 

Reproduce_baseline.py
---------------------
Also contained within the repository is a simple python script "Reproduce_baseline.py", used to reproduce the results reported in the accompanying paper (see below)

The script assumes you are familiar with Sphinx4. If you require assistance in installing and setting up Sphinx4, please see:
